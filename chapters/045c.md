### Reflection

Rest your mind like a leaf on still water. From that calm, say:

*Breathing in, I release clinging and fear.*

*Breathing out, I choose the path of compassion.*

*May my rebirth be a blessing,*

*a chance to serve and awaken.*

*Though appearances deceive,*

*I rest in impartiality.*

*O Great Compassionate One, guide me.*

*May the womb become a temple,*

*my life a gift to all beings.*
