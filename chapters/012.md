# Chapter 12: The Third Day — The Yellow Light of Ratna-Sambhava

Beloved one, even when the bright lights have come to meet you, old habits can still pull you away. Pride and the weight of past patterns may make you afraid of the dazzling truth, and instead you may reach for what is familiar.

On the Third Day, a radiant yellow light appears from the South. From that realm comes Ratna-Sambhava, bearing a jewel, seated on a horse-throne and embraced by the Divine Mother Sangyay-Chanma. Around him are compassionate attendants — bodhisattvas and female companions — and their light forms a rainbow halo.

From Ratna-Sambhava’s heart shoots the yellow light of Equality Wisdom — the wisdom of touch, of feeling things as they are without grasping. It is clear, glorious, and so bright that it almost overwhelms the eyes. Beside it there will also be a dull bluish-yellow glow — the pull of the human world, shaped by pride and self-importance.

Do not be startled by the shining yellow. It is not something to flee from. Know it as Wisdom. Trust it. Make this simple resolve: *“If this is the radiance of my own mind, I rest in it; if not, I take refuge in the grace of Ratna-Sambhava.”*

If you reach for the dull human light instead — if you let pride and ego draw you back — you will be pulled toward rebirth into human suffering. But if you meet the yellow brilliance with humility and focused devotion, you will merge into its radiance and awaken.

### What It Means

This day shows a familiar theme in the Bardo: liberation requires not only seeing the Light, but *choosing* it over habit. Ratna-Sambhava’s yellow radiance represents the wisdom that sees equality — the way things feel, touch, and interrelate without exaggeration, without pride. Pride, however, disguises itself as a kind of worthiness that clings to identity; it can make us prefer a lesser, familiar comfort to the greater truth.

The text offers a practical remedy: either recognize the light as your own mind, or intentionally take refuge in it as a compassionate other. Either way, humility and focused trust are the keys. This is not intellectual humility alone but a heart-level loosening of the ego’s grip.

The danger of choosing the human light is literal: it draws you back into birth, age, sickness, and death — the whole cycle you sought freedom from. The teaching is urgent because these choices, once made, have consequences.

### Reflection

Sit comfortably. Breathe slowly and picture a brilliant yellow light like the sun on a field of grain. Beside it is a muted blue-yellow glow that seems familiar and safe. Breathe and say quietly:

*When pride whispers, may I choose humility.*

*When the familiar calls me back, may I choose the greater Light.*

*May my heart take refuge in the wisdom that sees all things as equal,*

*and may I be led safely across the Bardo.*
