### What It Means

This section reminds us that in the Bardo, fear creates form. The winds, furies, and demons are not external beings but projections of unsettled mind. The same process that produces Buddhas through meditation can also produce spirits and pretas through confusion and fear.

The antidote is recognition and visualization. By calling upon a wrathful yet compassionate protector, one taps into the inner power of the awakened mind. These deities are mirrors of our own fierce clarity — the part of us strong enough to scatter illusions.

At the heart of the teaching lies the same refrain: everything terrifying is an emanation of the mind. To see through appearances, or at least not to cling, is liberation.
