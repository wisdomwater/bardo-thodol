### What It Means

This day is the culmination of the Peaceful Deities cycle. All the lights now blaze together — not sequentially, but in union. The teaching makes it plain: every light of wisdom is your own mind, appearing in radiant form. The challenge is to recognize this truth instead of being pulled by the dull lights of old karmic habits.

The six dull lights are particularly dangerous because they feel familiar. Each one corresponds to a realm of existence shaped by attachment, anger, pride, jealousy, or ignorance. To follow them is to be pulled back into rebirth. To resist their pull — and to recognize the brilliant lights as your own nature — is to be liberated.

The image of recognition “as a son knows his mother” is deeply tender. It means that awakening here is not about straining or achieving, but about remembering — recognizing what has always been yours.
