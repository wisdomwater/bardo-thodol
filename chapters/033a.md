# Chapter 33: The Closing of the Door of the Womb

O nobly-born, if you do not understand the earlier teachings, the pull of karma will draw you onward. You may feel as though you are rising upward, moving level, or sinking downward. Fierce winds, icy blasts, hail, darkness, and the sense of being pursued will come upon you.

If your karma is heavy and unwholesome, you will feel driven toward places of misery. If your karma is virtuous, you will feel drawn toward places of happiness. At that moment, signs of the place of your next birth will appear before you.

Now listen carefully. Even if you failed to recognize the earlier teachings, here you may still awaken, for even those of weak devotion often recognize the signs of rebirth. Therefore, remember the Compassionate One, and meditate upon Him.

At this stage, the teaching of closing the womb-door is most vital. Two methods are taught:

1. Preventing yourself from entering the womb.
2. Closing the womb itself so it may not be entered.

Hold these teachings well, for they determine whether you are swept again into samsara or remain in the freedom of the Clear Light.
