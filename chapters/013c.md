### Reflection

Close your eyes. Picture before you two lights: one brilliant, dazzling red like the heart of a flame; the other dull, dim, and murky, whispering comfort. Breathe and whisper:

*When craving calls me back, may I not be deceived.*

*When attachment stirs, may I let go.*

*May I walk into the blazing red light of wisdom,*

*And awaken in compassion’s embrace.*
