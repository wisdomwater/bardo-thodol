# Chapter 28: The After-Death Body

The officiant now addresses the deceased directly:

*O nobly-born, listen well.* When you fainted away after failing to recognize the deities of the *Chönyid Bardo*, your mind arose again in a subtle, radiant body. This body looks like the one you had in life and like the one you will take in rebirth. It is called the **desire-body**. It is a thought-form, born of karmic propensities, yet endowed with unusual powers.

* **All senses restored:** If you were blind, deaf, or lame in life, now your sight, hearing, and movement are flawless, sharper than before.
* **Unimpeded motion:** You can pass through mountains, walls, even the great Mount Meru, for this body is not made of flesh but of subtle thought.
* **Miraculous abilities:** You can travel across the four continents in an instant, move anywhere you wish as quickly as a man can stretch out his arm. These powers arise not from meditation but from karma.

You will also see others like yourself — beings wandering in the Bardo, destined for different realms. If you are to be reborn as a deva, visions of celestial palaces will appear; if as a brute, preta, or hell-being, those landscapes will draw near.

But be warned: these visions are snares. They are the pull of karma. Do not be attached to them, nor weakly drawn into their lights. To follow them blindly is to fall into the Six Realms of rebirth.

Even now, liberation is possible.

* **If you can:** Rest your mind in its own pure nature — the bright, empty awareness beyond grasping or fear. This is the true state your guru introduced you to. Rest there and you will not need to enter a womb.
* **If you cannot:** Then hold the image of your teacher or your chosen deity above your head with faith and devotion. Pray to them, call to them, take refuge in them. This is of great importance.
