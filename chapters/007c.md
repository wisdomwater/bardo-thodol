### Reflection

Close your eyes and imagine yourself unsure — not knowing if you are alive or gone. In that uncertainty, imagine a voice of kindness calling you back to compassion. Whisper softly:

*When confusion comes, may compassion guide me.*

*When fear grips me, may mercy free me.*

*Even in forgetfulness, may a gentle reminder*

*return me to the Light.*
