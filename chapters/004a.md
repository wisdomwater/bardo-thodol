# Chapter 4: The Clear Light Appears

Beloved one, the moment has come when the Clear Light shines in its fullness. It is vast and open, like the cloudless sky — no center, no edge, only luminous stillness. Your own mind, naked and pure, is revealed as this Light.

At this moment, know yourself. Rest here. Do not turn away. This is your true nature, the radiance you have always carried.

These words are spoken to you now, face to face, so that you may remember. Listen deeply: the Light is not outside you — it is what you are.

As the breath falters, let the body rest in the posture of the lion, lying on the right side. Let the vital force rise through the crown, carrying you upward into the radiant freedom.

For some, this state may last only the time it takes to snap a finger. For others, it may last as long as a meal, or even for days. However long it remains, know this: the opportunity is here. All beings experience this Clear Light, but few recognize it. Recognition is freedom.

So hear these words, again and again, until they echo within you:
*Beloved soul, the Clear Light is before you. Do not fear. Do not look away. Abide in it, and you will be free.*
