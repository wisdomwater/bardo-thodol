# Chapter 36: The Third Method of Closing the Womb-Door

O nobly-born, if the womb-door still has not been closed, and you find yourself ready to enter, this method will show you how to resist attraction and repulsion.

There are four kinds of birth: through egg, through womb, through heat and moisture, and through supernormal appearance. When visions of men and women in union appear, if you are swept in by attraction or repulsion, you may enter the womb and be born as human, animal, or other form.

If born as male, attraction to the mother and aversion toward the father will arise. If born as female, attraction to the father and aversion toward the mother will arise. This pull, mingled with jealousy, draws you into unconsciousness just as the sperm and egg unite. When you awaken, you may find yourself trapped in the form of an animal, or cast into one of the lower realms of suffering.

O nobly-born, the root of this fate is attraction and repulsion. Hear this profound teaching: when these emotions arise, meditate:

*“Alas! It is because of attraction and repulsion that I have wandered so long in suffering. If I continue to follow them, I will circle endlessly in misery. Now I will not act through attraction and repulsion. Henceforth, I renounce them.”*

By this resolve alone, the womb-door can be closed. Hold your mind one-pointedly. Be not distracted.
