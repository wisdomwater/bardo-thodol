### Reflection

Feel the air entering and leaving you — your first and oldest prayer. Whisper:

*Breathing in, I remember: these fears are my own mind.*

*Breathing out, I rest in the shelter of Compassion.*

*O Fierce Protector,*

*scatter the demons of fear,*

*scatter the winds of karma.*

*Let me not run blindly,*

*but pause,*

*recognize,*

*and choose with wisdom.*/*

*/*All forms are illusions,*

*all fears dissolve in the Light.*

*May I remember this truth,*

*and find freedom,*

*even here.*/*
