# Chapter 9: Sounds, Lights, and Rays

Beloved one, whatever fear or awe may come to you now in the Bardo, remember these words:

*When strange visions dawn,*

*May I see them as my own mind’s reflections.*

*When radiant beings appear,*

*May I know them as my thought-forms.*

*When great sounds roll like thunder,*

*May I recognize them as my very self.*

*When Light blazes forth,*

*May I not be afraid. May I rest in its embrace.*

When your body and mind separated, you glimpsed a radiance — dazzling, sparkling, like a spring mirage shimmering across a field. Do not be afraid of this brilliance. It is the radiance of your own true nature.

From the midst of that light comes a great sound, reverberating like thousands of thunders at once. Do not be awed or daunted — this, too, is your own true voice, the sound of Reality itself.

Remember: the body you have now is a body of thought. You cannot be harmed. Sounds, lights, and rays cannot wound you. They are your own forms. Recognize this: this is the Bardo.

If you do not recognize, then fear may overwhelm you. The lights may daunt, the sounds may terrify, and you will wander again in the circles of becoming. But if you remember, you are free.
