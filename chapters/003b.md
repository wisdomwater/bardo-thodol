### What It Means

The teaching here describes the *dissolution at death* — not as a tragedy, but as a moment of unveiling. When the senses close, the mind is revealed in its most naked form: luminous, clear, and vast.

This *Clear Light* is not foreign. It is the same essence we touch in deep meditation, in love, in awe before beauty. The difference at death is that all distractions fall away, leaving only the light itself.

The text reassures us that even if practice has been weak, even if memory falters, hearing the words in that moment can awaken recognition. It is a mercy: liberation is always possible, even at the last breath.
