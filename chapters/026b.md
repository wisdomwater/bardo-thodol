### What It Means

This passage is the climax of the Wrathful Deities’ appearance. The Lord of Death and his minions are not independent beings. They are the projection of your own karma, now exaggerated and dramatized by the power of the Bardo.

The teaching is clear:

* If you recognize them as your own thought-forms, they cannot harm you.
* If you run in fear, you are pulled deeper into Sangsāra, into rebirth.

It is both a comfort and a warning: all the gods and demons you face are made of the same essence as your own awareness. Liberation lies in knowing this, not in fleeing.
