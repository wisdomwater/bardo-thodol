# Chapter 22: The Eleventh Day — Padma-Heruka Appears

O beloved one, listen well. On this day, the blood-drinking deities of the Lotus, or Padma, Order will appear.

From the western quarter of your own mind arises Padma-Heruka, radiant and fierce, his body a deep reddish-black. He has three faces: the right white, the left blue, and the central a dark red. He stands with four strong legs and wields six hands: one holds a lotus, another a trident-staff, another a club; the left hands hold a bell, a skull-bowl brimming with blood, and a small drum.

He is embraced by Padma-Krotiśaurima, the Mother, who clasps his neck with one hand and offers a red shell filled with blood with the other. Father and Mother together blaze forth from the western quarter of your brain, shining directly before you.

Do not fear them. Do not turn away in terror. Rejoice instead, for they are not enemies but the living radiance of your own mind. They are your tutelary deities, and in truth they are none other than Amitābha, the Buddha of Infinite Light, appearing in their wrathful form. Recognize this, and liberation is yours in the very moment of recognition.
