### Reflection

Turn inward for a moment and notice the stillness waiting there. Whisper:

*Breathing in, I remember my true refuge.*

*Breathing out, I dissolve all forms into Light.*

*Breathing in, I steady my heart with one pure resolve.*

*Breathing out, I close the doors of illusion.*

*O Compassionate One, when the womb-doors open before me,*

*let me not be drawn by desire.*

*Let me not mistake illusion for refuge.*

*Strengthen me to hold a single, pure resolve.*

*May I remain in the Clear Light,*

*or rise into the realms of freedom,*

*and not fall again into the nets of bondage.*
