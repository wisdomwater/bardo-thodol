# Chapter 12: The Third Day — The Yellow Light of Ratna-Sambhava

Beloved one, even when the bright lights have come to meet you, old habits can still pull you away. Pride and the weight of past patterns may make you afraid of the dazzling truth, and instead you may reach for what is familiar.

On the Third Day, a radiant yellow light appears from the South. From that realm comes Ratna-Sambhava, bearing a jewel, seated on a horse-throne and embraced by the Divine Mother Sangyay-Chanma. Around him are compassionate attendants — bodhisattvas and female companions — and their light forms a rainbow halo.

From Ratna-Sambhava’s heart shoots the yellow light of Equality Wisdom — the wisdom of touch, of feeling things as they are without grasping. It is clear, glorious, and so bright that it almost overwhelms the eyes. Beside it there will also be a dull bluish-yellow glow — the pull of the human world, shaped by pride and self-importance.

Do not be startled by the shining yellow. It is not something to flee from. Know it as Wisdom. Trust it. Make this simple resolve: *“If this is the radiance of my own mind, I rest in it; if not, I take refuge in the grace of Ratna-Sambhava.”*

If you reach for the dull human light instead — if you let pride and ego draw you back — you will be pulled toward rebirth into human suffering. But if you meet the yellow brilliance with humility and focused devotion, you will merge into its radiance and awaken.
