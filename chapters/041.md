## The Premonitory Visions of the Place of Rebirth

O nobly-born, now the signs of the place of rebirth will appear before you. Recognize them.

If you see a lake with swans upon it, that is the Eastern Continent of Lüpah. Do not go there. Though there is ease and bliss, the Dharma does not flourish there.

If you see splendid mansions, that is the Southern Continent of Jambu. If you must take birth, enter there.

If you see a lake with horses grazing near its shores, that is the Western Continent of Balang-Chöd. Do not go there, for although abundance reigns, religion does not.

If you see a lake with cattle or beautiful trees, that is the Northern Continent of Daminyan. Though long life is found there, the Dharma is not. Do not go there.

If you see radiant temples of precious metals, you may enter — for that is the realm of the gods.

If you see forests or fiery circles, that is the realm of the asuras. Turn away.

If you see caverns, holes, or mists, that is the realm of beasts. Enter not.

If you see wastelands, plains without trees, or empty glades, that is the realm of hungry ghosts. Do not go.

If you hear cries of lament and see dark roads, black holes, or shadowy houses, that is the realm of Hell. Turn back; go not there, lest you suffer long.

Exert your strength now. Resist these doors.

### What It Means

At the threshold of rebirth, visions come that mirror the Six Realms of existence. These visions are not random — they reveal where karmic forces are leading. The teaching gives us discernment: which visions to resist, which to embrace.

The Southern Continent, where Dharma prevails, is considered the most fortunate human rebirth, for it is the ground of practice. Even devas (gods), though radiant, are often lulled into complacency; the human realm offers the chance to awaken through both joy and suffering.

The warning is clear: wealth, beauty, or ease without Dharma leads to wandering. Better to choose conditions that, though imperfect, turn the heart toward awakening. The heart of this teaching is intentionality at the very brink: even if karma pulls, awareness can still redirect.

## Reflection / Breath Prayer

Lean back slightly and let gravity hold you. In that rest, say:

*Breathing in, I see the doors of many worlds.
Breathing out, I turn toward wisdom.*

*O Compassionate Ones,
protect me from paths of suffering.
If I must take birth again,
let it be where Dharma flourishes.
Let me awaken in a realm
where compassion may grow,
where wisdom may shine,
and where freedom may be found.*
