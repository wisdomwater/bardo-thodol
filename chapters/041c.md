### Reflection

Lean back slightly and let gravity hold you. In that rest, say:

*Breathing in, I see the doors of many worlds.*

*Breathing out, I turn toward wisdom.*

*O Compassionate Ones,*

*protect me from paths of suffering.*

*If I must take birth again,*

*let it be where Dharma flourishes.*

*Let me awaken in a realm*

*where compassion may grow,*

*where wisdom may shine,*

*and where freedom may be found.*
