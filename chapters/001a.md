# Chapter 1: The Great Doorway

Beloved one, listen with the ears of your heart.
There is a wisdom so vast it cannot be captured by words — the Boundless Light, the Divine Reality beyond form. To this Light we bow.

There is a wisdom that takes shape as kindness, appearing as peaceful and wrathful guides, who are none other than reflections of the truth within. To these guides we bow.

There is a wisdom that walks among us in human form, a protector who shows the way of freedom. To the teachers and guides who came before, we bow.

This teaching is called the *Great Liberation by Hearing*. It is medicine for the soul in the in-between states, when the body fades and the spirit is unmoored. Its purpose is freedom — not only for the wise, but for all who hear.

At the threshold of death, one is counseled to recognize the signs of departure: the body grows weak, the breath changes, the senses withdraw. These are not failures — they are signals of passage.

At that moment, remember this: consciousness itself may be set free by simply turning toward the truth. Some will find freedom through great intellect, some through practice, but for all — even for those of “ordinary wit” — this path can open the door.
