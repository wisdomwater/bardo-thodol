### What It Means

This final stage of the Wrathful Deities is the ultimate confrontation with the shadow. The visions are terrifying: animal-headed goddesses, blood, corpses, weapons. Yet the text insists: *they are your own thought-forms*.

The teaching is simple but profound:

* If you recognize these visions as your own mind, they become radiant allies and you awaken.
* If you recoil, treating them as “other,” you fall back into delusion and the cycle of rebirth.

Here the wisdom of the Vajrayana path is distilled: liberation comes not from running away, but from recognition and integration. The fiercest deities are not enemies, but your own powers in fierce disguise.
