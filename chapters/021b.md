### What It Means

The Ratna, or Jewel, family represents equanimity and abundance. Ratna-Sambhava is the giver of richness, the one who transforms pride and greed into the spacious wisdom of equality.

Here he appears as Ratna-Heruka, fierce and blazing, yet still your own essence. The yellow light and jewel he holds symbolize both wealth and the deep truth that all beings share the same worth. The skull-bowl and tridents remind you that clinging to possessions, status, or identity is empty — these, too, are dissolved in wisdom.

The challenge of this day is to see abundance not as something to grasp at, but as your own innate nature. To recognize that the terror of loss and the greed for gain are illusions. When you know this, the wrathful transforms into the liberating, and you rest in the wisdom of equality.
