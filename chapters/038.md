# Chapter 38: The Fifth Method of Closing the Womb-Door

Still, even if illusions remain and the womb-door has not closed, meditate upon the Clear Light.

Think thus:

“Lo! All things are but my own mind. And this mind is empty, unborn, and ceaseless.

Like water poured into water, let it rest in its natural state — uncreated, clear, and vibrant.”

By abiding in this relaxed, luminous awareness, the womb-doors of all four kinds of birth will be closed.

### What It Means

Here the teachings return us to the heart of the path: the Clear Light of mind itself. All other practices — rejecting fear, dissolving attraction and repulsion, recognizing illusions — culminate in this simple resting in awareness.

The metaphor is striking: *water poured into water.* Nothing to grasp, nothing to fix, nothing separate. Just the flow of mind merging with its own true nature.

This is not about forceful concentration, but a gentle return. The womb-door — the compulsion to take form again in the Sangsāra — closes not by resistance, but by recognition. When we see that mind is unborn, unceasing, and radiant, rebirth loosens its grip.

### Reflection

Let your jaw loosen, your brow smooth. With ease, whisper:

*Breathing in, I rest in the unborn.*

*Breathing out, I rest in the unceasing.*

*Breathing in, my mind is like water poured into water.*

*Breathing out, I am clear, vibrant, uncreated.*

*O Compassionate One,*

*let me not mistake form for substance,*

*nor fear for truth.*

*May I rest in the Clear Light,*

*where birth and death lose their hold,*

*and freedom shines without end.*
