## Womb-Birth: The Return to the Human World

O nobly-born, if supernormal birth into a Pure Land is not possible, and you must take birth in this world again, listen well.

With your foresight, look across the Continents. Choose the land where Dharma is strong and enter there.

When birth is near, you may see what looks impure yet smells sweet — a vision drawing you toward it. Do not be deceived. Appearances can mislead.

Choose carefully, directing your wish:
“May I take birth as one able to serve beings — as a Universal Emperor, a Brāhmin like a great tree, the child of an adept, or in a family of faith. May I be endowed with merit and live to benefit all.”

As you enter the womb, send forth waves of compassion. Transform the place of birth into a celestial palace. Believe that Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and the Great Compassionate One bless your new life.

But beware: through karma, good wombs may appear bad, and bad wombs good. Do not cling. Do not reject. Enter impartially, with a mind free from attraction or repulsion.

If you cannot do this, take refuge in the Precious Trinity, in the Great Compassionate One. Cast off longing for children, wealth, or kin — they cannot help you now. Enter upon the Light of the devas or the Yellow Light of humans.

This passage is a teaching in humility and discernment. If liberation has not been secured, we are guided to choose wisely where to return. Even the act of entering the womb can be done with clarity, compassion, and devotion.

The warning is clear: do not be fooled by appearances. What looks inviting may bind you to suffering; what seems difficult may actually be a doorway of blessing. The art is to release both attraction and repulsion, entering with neutrality. This is a profound practice even for daily life: to step into circumstances without clinging or aversion, but with steady presence.

Most importantly, this section reminds us to direct intention. Even if rebirth is inevitable, you can choose to dedicate it for the good of all beings. You can shape the trajectory of your return by aligning it with compassion and Dharma.

*Breathing in, I release clinging and fear.
Breathing out, I choose the path of compassion.*

May my rebirth be a blessing,
a chance to serve and awaken.

Though appearances deceive,
I rest in impartiality.

O Great Compassionate One, guide me.
May the womb become a temple,
my life a gift to all beings.
