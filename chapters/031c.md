### Reflection

Let your shoulders drop. Allow the tension to melt as you murmur:

*Breathing in, I release resentment.*

*Breathing out, I rest in trust.*

*Breathing in, I let go of clinging.*

*Breathing out, I dedicate all I have to the Three Jewels.*

*O Compassionate One,*

*when anger rises, soften me with love.*

*When jealousy arises, loosen me with trust.*

*When despair arises, lift me with light.*

*May every thought become a step toward freedom.*
