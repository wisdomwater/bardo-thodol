# Chapter 8: Entering the Bardo of Reality

Beloved one, you have been given the Light once — perhaps twice — and still you wander. Now a new stage dawns: the Bardo of the Experiencing of Reality. Here the world of appearances rises like a theatre of sound and light. Karmic visions will shine — sometimes gentle, sometimes terrifying — and the mind may be bewildered.

Listen closely. There are six kinds of bardos in the whole weave of life and death: the bardo of the womb, the bardo of dreams, the bardo of deep meditative equipoise, the bardo of the moment of death, the bardo of experiencing reality (this one), and the bardo that leads toward rebirth. You have just passed the moment of death; now you enter the Chönyid Bardo and, after that, the Sidpa Bardo.

Do not be surprised by what you see. You will notice household sounds — food being prepared, clothes taken away, the sorrow of friends. You will hear your name and yet feel unseen. Do not cling in confusion. Do not be drawn back by grief or attachment; such pulling will only lead to wandering in samsāra. Hear these words as if they were spoken into the ear of your own heart: this is not the place to grasp. Hold steady. Attend.

If you are near, call the beloved by name and speak with loving clarity: explain that this is the Chönyid Bardo, and urge the mind to listen and remain undistracted. Remind them gently to remember the Precious Three — the teachers, the truth, the path — and to refrain from clinging to the scenes that arise.
