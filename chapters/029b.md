### What It Means

This passage describes the Intermediate State of Becoming (Sidpa Bardo), where the soul searches for rebirth. The greatest suffering here is *longing*—longing for loved ones, for stability, for a body again. But these cravings only deepen the cycle of Samsāra.

The terrifying visions—the demons, storms, abysses—are not external forces. They are the mind’s own projections, born from anger, lust, and ignorance. Even beauty and ease can be traps if clung to. The teaching reminds us: whether blissful or fearful, all appearances are illusions of mind.

Liberation comes not by fighting or fleeing, but by recognizing the illusions as illusions and resting in awareness itself. Even in sorrow, even in fear, the light of the Compassionate One is present. By remembering, surrendering, and letting go, one can be free.
