### Reflection

Close your eyes and listen for the quiet beneath your thoughts. Whisper:

*When sorrow comes, may I not cling.*

*When fear arises, may I not flee.*

*When longing burns, may I rest in awareness.*

*O Compassionate One,*

*be my refuge in the storm.*

*Even in wandering,*

*may I remember my true home.*
