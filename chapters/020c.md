### Reflection

Imagine a fierce, radiant being, blue as midnight, blazing with eyes and arms. Let fear rise, but hold steady. Whisper to yourself:

*This is my mind in its fierce form.*

*This is wisdom unshakable,*

*diamond-clear and indestructible.*

*I will not fear. I will recognize.*

*In recognition, I am free.*
