# Chapter 35: The Second Method of Closing the Womb-Door

O nobly-born, at this time you may see visions of men and women in union. If you see them, do not be drawn into the space between them.

Instead, regard the father and mother you see as the form of your Guru and the Divine Mother. Bow before them. With humility, offer them your devotion and mental worship, and resolve that you will ask them for spiritual guidance.

This alone can close the womb-door. But if it does not, and you find yourself still ready to enter, then meditate upon the Guru Father-Mother as you would upon your tutelary deity, or upon the Compassionate Lord and His Consort. Worship them inwardly with offerings of the mind, and resolve earnestly that you will ask of them a boon. By this resolve, the womb-door will be closed.
