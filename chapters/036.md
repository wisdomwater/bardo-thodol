# Chapter 36: The Third Method of Closing the Womb-Door

O nobly-born, if the womb-door still has not been closed, and you find yourself ready to enter, this method will show you how to resist attraction and repulsion.

There are four kinds of birth: through egg, through womb, through heat and moisture, and through supernormal appearance. When visions of men and women in union appear, if you are swept in by attraction or repulsion, you may enter the womb and be born as human, animal, or other form.

If born as male, attraction to the mother and aversion toward the father will arise. If born as female, attraction to the father and aversion toward the mother will arise. This pull, mingled with jealousy, draws you into unconsciousness just as the sperm and egg unite. When you awaken, you may find yourself trapped in the form of an animal, or cast into one of the lower realms of suffering.

O nobly-born, the root of this fate is attraction and repulsion. Hear this profound teaching: when these emotions arise, meditate:

*“Alas! It is because of attraction and repulsion that I have wandered so long in suffering. If I continue to follow them, I will circle endlessly in misery. Now I will not act through attraction and repulsion. Henceforth, I renounce them.”*

By this resolve alone, the womb-door can be closed. Hold your mind one-pointedly. Be not distracted.

### What It Means

This passage shows us how the very energies of love and hate, when left unexamined, can bind us into existence after existence. Attraction and repulsion are two sides of the same coin, and both lead to bondage.

The practice is radical: to pause in the moment of strongest pull — even at the threshold of rebirth — and name the pattern: *This is attraction. This is aversion. I will not follow them.* By doing so, one redirects the flow of karma and reclaims freedom.

The essence is to replace grasping and rejection with steadiness and devotion. The teaching assures us that a single, undistracted resolve can close the door to rebirth and open the way to liberation.

### Reflection

Let your eyes close halfway, as if seeing the world through grace. Gently speak:

*Breathing in, I see attraction arise.*

*Breathing out, I release it.*

*Breathing in, I see aversion arise.*

*Breathing out, I let it go.*

*O Compassionate One,*

*teach me to see the root of my wandering.*

*When I am pulled by love or hate,*

*let me remember the deeper truth.*

*Let my heart rest in pure devotion.*

*Let the womb-door close,*

*and may freedom be born within me.*
