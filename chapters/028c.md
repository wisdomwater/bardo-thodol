### Reflection

Place a hand on your heart and feel its steady rhythm. Softly say to yourself:

*Even in the in-between,*

*the mind is radiant,*

*the senses clear,*

*the power vast.*

*Yet visions deceive.*

*May I not be drawn by illusion,*

*but rest in the bright, empty nature*

*of mind itself.*

*If I falter,*

*may devotion hold me,*

*and may the Compassionate Ones*

*lead me home.*
