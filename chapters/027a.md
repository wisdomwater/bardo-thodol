# Chapter 27: Conclusion - The Power of the Bardo Teachings

Whatever practices a person may have undertaken in life — whether great or small — illusions will arise at the time of death. For this reason, the *Thödol*, the “Great Liberation by Hearing,” is indispensable.

For those who have practiced meditation deeply, the Truth itself dawns instantly when body and mind part. Those who have recognized their true nature even a little while alive will find great strength when the Clear Light shines at death.

Those who have trained in visualizing and embodying the deities of the Mantra Path will find this practice vital when the Peaceful and Wrathful deities appear in the *Chönyid Bardo*. The training itself is precious — to study, to memorize, to hear these words again and again so that even if a hundred distractions or fears arose, the essence would not be forgotten.

This text is called the *Great Liberation by Hearing* because even those who have committed the gravest of sins can be freed simply by hearing its words. Therefore it should be read in public gatherings, whispered in the ears of the dying, placed under the pillow of the sick, and spoken beside the dead.

Fortunate indeed are those who meet these teachings. Rare it is to encounter them, and rarer still to understand them. Yet even a single hearing plants a seed. Even without full comprehension, in the Bardo these words return to the mind with clarity.

So treat this teaching as a treasure. It is the distilled essence of all doctrines. To hear it without disbelief is already to step onto the path of liberation.

Here ends the *Setting-Face-to-Face while Experiencing Reality in the Intermediate State*, known as *The Teaching Which Liberates by Mere Hearing, and by Mere Connection*.
