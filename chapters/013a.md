# Chapter 13: The Fourth Day — The Red Light of Amitābha

Beloved one, even if the path has been shown again and again, some still turn away. Old habits, vows broken, covetousness, and attachment cloud the vision. When clinging grips the heart, even the sounds and lights of wisdom may feel frightening.

On the Fourth Day, the red light of fire dawns. From the Western Realm of Bliss appears the Buddha Amitābha, radiant red, seated upon a peacock throne, holding the lotus of compassion, embraced by the Divine Mother Gökarmo. With them shine the bodhisattvas Chenrazee (Avalokiteśvara) and Jampal (Mañjuśrī), and the female companions Ghirdhima and Āloke — six radiant beings, surrounded by a rainbow halo of light.

From their heart streams the brilliant red light of Discriminating Wisdom, glittering, dazzling, bright beyond measure. It strikes directly into your heart, too radiant to gaze upon. Alongside it glimmers a dull, murky red glow: the light of the hungry ghosts, the Pretas, born of attachment and greed.

Because of clinging desire, you may shrink from the bright red brilliance and turn instead toward the softer, dull glow. But beware: that glow leads into the realm of craving and unquenchable thirst. There, endless hunger and longing await.

Therefore, listen well: Do not be afraid of the blazing red light. It is your own wisdom, shining. Recognize it, merge with it, and you will awaken. If recognition feels beyond you, then turn humbly to Amitābha, praying:

*Alas! Wandering in samsāra through the power of attachment,*

*On the radiant red path of Discriminating Wisdom,*

*May I be led by the Buddha Amitābha.*

*May the Divine Mother Gökarmo guard my back.*

*May I cross safely through the fearful ambush of the Bardo,*

*And awaken in the perfect Buddhahood of the Western Realm.*
