# Invocation of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas

O Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, dwelling in the ten directions,

full of compassion, wisdom, and love,

seeing with the divine eye,

protectors of all beings—

come now through the power of your great compassion.

Accept these offerings, both those placed here

and those offered from the heart.

---

O Compassionate Ones,

you who hold the wisdom of understanding,

the love that heals,

and the power to protect beyond measure—

here before you, one of your children (name)

is passing from this world to the next.

The journey is great.

The friends of this life cannot go along.

He enters the dark,

he walks a steep and lonely path.

He is carried by the winds of karma,

swept into the silence,

driven onward by forces unseen.

No strength has he now;

this is the time when all must go alone.

---

O Compassionate Ones, defend him who is defenseless.

Protect him who has no protector.

Be his strength, his kin, his refuge.

Keep him safe from the deep shadows of the Bardo.

Turn him away from the storm-winds of karma.

Turn him away from the terror of the Lords of Death.

Save him from the narrow passageways of fear.

---

O Compassionate Ones, let not your mercy grow faint.

Do not forget your ancient vows.

Hold him fast with the hook of your grace.

Let not the weight of karma cast him down.

---

O Buddhas, O Bodhisattvas, O Holy Trinity,

carry him beyond the suffering of the Bardo.

---

(Recite this prayer three times, with humility and faith.)
