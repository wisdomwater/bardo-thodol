### What It Means

The conclusion is a reminder of hope and mercy. The path through the Bardos is not a single doorway but many. At each stage there is another chance to recognize, to turn, to be freed. The text itself is a compassionate companion: it liberates by being heard, by being remembered, even by being seen.

For the living, the message is clear: prepare now, while breath still fills the body. Commit the teachings to memory, let them shape the heart. But also, know this: even if you feel unready, even if you falter, compassion still pursues you into death. *There is always another chance.*

This is the great promise: no one is abandoned. However far one falls, the Divine Light seeks us out.
