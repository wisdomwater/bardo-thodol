### Reflection

Feel your feet on the ground, rooted and safe. Breathe out the words:

*Breathing in, I see every light as compassion.*

*Breathing out, I rest in the embrace of the Dharma-Kāya.*

*Breathing in, I release my search for another body.*

*Breathing out, I awaken in the Clear Light.*

*O Compassionate One,*

*when the lights of the six realms call me,*

*let me not be drawn by fear or desire.*

*Let me see only You —*

*in gods and humans, in animals and hungry ghosts,*

*in heaven and in hell.*

*In every light, let me behold the radiance of the Dharma-Kāya.*

*In this recognition, may I awaken to freedom.*
