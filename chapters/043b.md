### What It Means

This passage confronts us with the ultimate choice of rebirth. Even in the midst of confusion and karmic pressure, the teachings remind us: *pause, recognize, and choose consciously*. Not every doorway that opens is meant for us. Some lead into cycles of suffering; others, into realms of clarity.

The teaching highlights our latent foreknowledge in this state — a faint intuition of what lies beyond each doorway. The appearance of options is not random; it is the flowering of our karma. Still, by remembering, by praying, and by invoking compassion, there remains freedom to choose differently.

Supernormal birth into a Pure Land — the Buddha realms of light and wisdom — represents liberation. Entering a womb is re-entry into samsara, where lessons continue in fleshly form. Both paths are possibilities, but one leads beyond suffering.
