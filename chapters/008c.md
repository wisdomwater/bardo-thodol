### Reflection

Sit for a moment and breathe slowly. Imagine sounds and images washing around you like waves. Practice being the witness of those waves without diving into any one of them. Whisper or breathe this little prayer:

*This is a passage, not a prison.*

*May I not cling to shadows.*

*May loving speech and steady attention guide me into the Light.*

*When illusions rise, may I remember my true home.*
