# Chapter 20: The Ninth Day — Vajra-Heruka Appears

Beloved one, listen closely and without distraction. If you turned away from the vision of the Great Heruka, then today the blood-drinking deities of the Vajra Order will appear before you.

From the eastern quarter of your mind will emerge Bhagavān Vajra-Heruka, dark blue in color, with three faces, six hands, and four powerful legs. In his right hands he holds a dorje, a skull-bowl, and a battle-axe. In his left hands he bears a bell, another skull-bowl, and a ploughshare.

He is embraced by the Mother, Vajra-Krotiśaurima, who clasps his neck with her right hand while offering him a red shell filled with blood with her left. Together they blaze forth, radiant and fierce, shining directly upon you.

Do not fear them. Do not recoil in terror or awe. Know this: they are the reflection of your own mind. Vajra-Heruka is none other than Vajra-Sattva, Father and Mother, appearing now in wrathful form. If you recognize this truth, and merge with them in oneness, liberation will come at once, and Buddhahood will be attained.
