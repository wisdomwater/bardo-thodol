# Chapter 46: The General Conclusion

Those who are well-practiced may not even need to pass through the Intermediate State at all — they will rise straight upward, liberated at the moment of death. Others, a little less practiced, may recognize the Clear Light or one of the Deities in the first two weeks, and so be freed.

For those of heavier karma, there are still many “turning points,” many rungs of the ladder, where recognition may happen. Even the weakest, if they hear this Teaching, can find refuge and turn from misery toward a human birth where Dharma may be practiced again.

This is why this Thödol is read at the bedside of the dying and to the departed. For in the Bardo the mind is clear, sensitive, and easily influenced. A single reminder can turn the heart toward liberation. The words need only be heard — even imperfectly, even without full comprehension — and they take root.

Therefore, let it be read. Let no one despair. Even those with the heaviest burdens of karma can be lifted. Let no one say, “It is too late.” This Teaching is the great bridge, carrying us across.
