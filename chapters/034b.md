### What It Means

Here, the teaching emphasizes that rebirth begins with desire and distraction. The way to prevent it is through *clarity* and *resolve*. To see your deity dissolve into pure Light is to remember that all forms, even the body you long for, are illusion.

The “womb-door” is both literal and symbolic. Literally, it is the pull toward a new physical body. Symbolically, it is the pull of desire into any binding form — be it anger, jealousy, or attachment. Closing the womb-door means refusing to be caught by illusion and resting instead in the Clear Light.

The instruction to hold “one single resolve” is profound: in this subtle state, the mind is highly powerful and creative. Even a flicker of anger or longing can determine your rebirth. But so too can a flicker of devotion, love, and remembrance of the Guru or the Compassionate One lead you upward or even free you entirely.
