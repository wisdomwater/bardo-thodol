### Reflection

Sit quietly. Close your eyes. Imagine your last breath leaving the body, and in its place a great radiance dawning before you — not outside, but within. Say softly:

*When the time of death comes, may I remember the Light.*

*When fear arises, may I rest in trust.*

*The Light is not apart from me; it is my very being.*

*In that recognition, may I be free.*
