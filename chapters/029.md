# Chapter 29: The Sidpa Bardo – Characteristics of Existence

O nobly-born, in this state you may see your family and your home. You may try to speak, but no one replies. Then sorrow comes, as you think: *“I am dead! What shall I do?”*

You are carried by the winds of karma, with no place to rest, drifting like a feather in a storm. Around you is a twilight that never changes. This wandering may last up to seven weeks, though most remain about twenty-two days, depending on karma.

Terrifying visions appear—darkness, storms, demons, collapsing mountains, floods, and fire. Voices cry, *“Strike! Slay!”* In your fear, you may see great abysses before you—white, red, and black. They are not real precipices but the powers of Anger, Lust, and Ignorance.

Some will experience joy and ease, others only dull indifference. Those of heavy karma will face terror. But all these visions are nothing more than the radiance of your own mind.

Longing for a body may arise. You may try to return to your corpse, but it is too late. It has decayed, or been burned, or given to the birds. Feeling trapped and without rest, you are drawn by desire to seek a new body. This is the suffering of the Sidpa Bardo.

Put aside the craving for flesh. Rest the mind in the clear awareness of its own nature. Call upon your guru and the Compassionate Ones. In stillness and surrender, liberation is possible even now.

### What It Means

This passage describes the Intermediate State of Becoming (Sidpa Bardo), where the soul searches for rebirth. The greatest suffering here is *longing*—longing for loved ones, for stability, for a body again. But these cravings only deepen the cycle of Samsāra.

The terrifying visions—the demons, storms, abysses—are not external forces. They are the mind’s own projections, born from anger, lust, and ignorance. Even beauty and ease can be traps if clung to. The teaching reminds us: whether blissful or fearful, all appearances are illusions of mind.

Liberation comes not by fighting or fleeing, but by recognizing the illusions as illusions and resting in awareness itself. Even in sorrow, even in fear, the light of the Compassionate One is present. By remembering, surrendering, and letting go, one can be free.

### Reflection

Close your eyes and listen for the quiet beneath your thoughts. Whisper:

*When sorrow comes, may I not cling.*

*When fear arises, may I not flee.*

*When longing burns, may I rest in awareness.*

*O Compassionate One,*

*be my refuge in the storm.*

*Even in wandering,*

*may I remember my true home.*
