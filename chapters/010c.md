### Reflection

Close your eyes. Imagine a deep, radiant blue light filling the sky before you — so bright it almost frightens you. Beside it is a softer, more familiar glow that seems comforting. Whisper:

*When faced with the Light of Truth, may I not turn away.*

*When tempted by comfort that binds me, may I let go.*

*May I walk into the dazzling blue radiance,*

*And awaken in the heart of wisdom.*
