# Chapter 5: The Radiance of Compassion

Beloved one, the final dissolutions are upon you. Earth sinks into water, water into fire, fire into air, and air into space. The body fades, and the mind opens to the vast expanse.

At this moment, keep your mind steady. Do not be distracted. Listen:
*O noble soul, this is the hour of death. By entering this passage, may you awaken for the good of all beings. Resolve with love and compassion: “May this very death become the doorway to Buddhahood. May I use it to serve every being, as countless as the sky.”*

Even if full awakening is beyond reach, hold this vow: *“I will master the in-between state. I will take whatever form may help others. I will not turn away from compassion.”*

Now, as the Clear Light shines, recognize it. Your own mind, naked and luminous, is not a void of nothingness but a living radiance — unobstructed, blissful, and free. This very consciousness is the Buddha, the All-Good.

Know this truth: your awareness and the radiant Light are not two. They are one union, the body of Perfect Enlightenment itself.
