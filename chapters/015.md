# Chapter 15: The Sixth Day — The Union of All Lights

Beloved one, you have been set face to face with many lights, day after day. Each one was an open door, yet old habits, fear, or awe may have turned you aside. Still, even now, liberation is possible.

On the Sixth Day, all the radiant deities appear together. The Five Buddhas with their Divine Consorts — Vairochana, Vajrasattva, Ratnasambhava, Amitābha, and Amogha-Siddhi — come shining at once, each with their attendants, in rainbow halos of dazzling light.

Around them stand the wrathful guardians, the door-keepers with fierce forms and their companions, holding goads, chains, nooses, and bells. They too shine, not as enemies, but as protectors. With them appear the Buddhas of the six realms: of gods, of asuras, of humans, of animals, of hungry ghosts, and of the lower world — each bearing their aspect of truth.

Beyond them all, the All-Good Father Samantabhadra and the All-Good Mother Samantabhadrī radiate forth — the primordial source of all the Buddhas.

Forty-two deities now shine upon you in a great conclave of light. Know this: none of them come from outside. They all arise from within your own heart. They are your own thought-forms, your own wisdom, your own love, given shape.

The light they emit is subtle, clear, radiant, like sunlight spun into threads, striking against your heart.

### What It Means

This day is both the most overwhelming and the most revealing. All the deities — peaceful and wrathful, serene and fierce — appear together. It is the great unveiling: the recognition that every divine form, every sound, every light, is a manifestation of your own innermost nature.

The teaching insists: nothing comes from outside. The vast assembly of Buddhas and guardians is not foreign. They are your own mind’s radiant display. To recognize this is to know that all appearances — bright or terrifying — are inseparable from your true self.

The fierce forms remind us of the energies we often repress or fear in life. In the Bardo, they return, not to harm, but to awaken. They are the same radiance as the peaceful Buddhas, wearing masks of intensity to break through resistance.

The instruction here is simple and profound: *Do not be afraid. Recognize all these forms as your own mind. Rest in the union of all wisdoms, and you will be free.*

### Reflection

Close your eyes and imagine yourself surrounded by a vast circle of light-beings — peaceful and fierce, gentle and powerful. Let them dazzle you, but do not shrink away. Instead, place your hand on your heart. Whisper gently:

*All these forms arise within me.*

*None come from outside.*

*Peaceful and wrathful, fierce and gentle,*

*all are radiance of my own heart.*

*May I recognize them as such,*

*and rest in the union of all wisdoms.*
