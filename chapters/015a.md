# Chapter 15: The Sixth Day — The Union of All Lights

Beloved one, you have been set face to face with many lights, day after day. Each one was an open door, yet old habits, fear, or awe may have turned you aside. Still, even now, liberation is possible.

On the Sixth Day, all the radiant deities appear together. The Five Buddhas with their Divine Consorts — Vairochana, Vajrasattva, Ratnasambhava, Amitābha, and Amogha-Siddhi — come shining at once, each with their attendants, in rainbow halos of dazzling light.

Around them stand the wrathful guardians, the door-keepers with fierce forms and their companions, holding goads, chains, nooses, and bells. They too shine, not as enemies, but as protectors. With them appear the Buddhas of the six realms: of gods, of asuras, of humans, of animals, of hungry ghosts, and of the lower world — each bearing their aspect of truth.

Beyond them all, the All-Good Father Samantabhadra and the All-Good Mother Samantabhadrī radiate forth — the primordial source of all the Buddhas.

Forty-two deities now shine upon you in a great conclave of light. Know this: none of them come from outside. They all arise from within your own heart. They are your own thought-forms, your own wisdom, your own love, given shape.

The light they emit is subtle, clear, radiant, like sunlight spun into threads, striking against your heart.
