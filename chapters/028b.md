### What It Means

The *Sidpa Bardo* is a sobering stage: consciousness is no longer face-to-face with dazzling deities but is instead drawn by karmic winds toward rebirth. The “desire-body” has godlike powers, yet it is fragile, vulnerable to illusion. Here the teaching insists again and again: do not be fooled. What appears is not external reality but projections of your own mind.

The promise is clear: even now, if recognition dawns — if one remembers the guru’s instructions, or if devotion to the deity arises wholeheartedly — liberation is possible. If not, the pull of karma carries the soul toward a new birth.
