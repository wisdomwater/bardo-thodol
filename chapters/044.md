# Chapter 44: Supernormal Birth by Transference to a Paradise Realm

O nobly-born, if you choose transference to a Pure Land, meditate thus:

“Alas! Through countless aeons I have wandered in the quagmire of samsara, blind to my true nature, circling in birth and death. How painful that I have not yet been liberated into Buddhahood!

Now I am sickened and horrified by this endless wandering. The time has come to flee. I resolve to be born in the Happy Western Realm, at the feet of Buddha Amitābha, miraculously within a lotus blossom.”

Think this with one-pointed resolve. Or, if you prefer another Realm — The Pre-eminently Happy Realm, The Thickly-Formed Realm, The Realm of Long Hair, or the Illimitable Vihāra of the Lotus Radiance in Urgyan’s presence — direct your wish there with undistracted mind. By doing so, birth in that Realm occurs instantaneously.

If you desire to be with Maitreya in the Tushita Heavens, think with earnestness: “I will go to the presence of Maitreya in the Tushita Heavens, for the hour has struck for me here in the Intermediate State.” By that wish, you will be born miraculously inside a lotus blossom in Maitreya’s presence.

### What It Means

This passage offers the direct path to liberation through supernormal birth. Even if karmic obscurations remain, heartfelt aspiration can leap beyond samsara. The “Pure Lands” described here are not myths or external heavens but luminous states of mind where practice and awakening unfold effortlessly.

The text instructs: name your destination, choose it with clarity, and place your whole being in that vow. This is the art of conscious rebirth. The lotus blossom is a metaphor for rebirth without defilement — awakening directly into a field of compassion and wisdom.

This section also reveals something comforting: even if you have not achieved complete realization, your *heartfelt longing* — disgust for samsara combined with trust in the Buddhas — can carry you into a realm of safety and practice.

### Reflection

Draw your attention to your heartbeat — the drum of life within you. Whisper:

*Breathing in, I release the old paths.*

*Breathing out, I open to a Pure Land.*

*Alas, I have wandered through countless lives.*

*Let my longing for freedom ripen now.*

*May I be born in the Pure Land of Amitābha,*

*or in whatever Realm is best for awakening.*

*Within a lotus of compassion may I arise,*

*in the presence of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,*

*free from defilement, ready to awaken.*

*I entrust myself wholly*

*to the Compassionate One.*
