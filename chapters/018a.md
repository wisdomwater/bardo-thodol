# Chapter 18: Introduction to the Wrathful Deities

Beloved one, you have passed through the cycle of the Peaceful Deities, seven days of radiant openings. Many beings are liberated in those stages, recognizing the lights and merging with them. Yet, the number of souls is vast, and many are still bound by old karma, dense obscurations, and long habits. Fear and ignorance lead them downwards, unliberated.

Now a new cycle dawns: the Wrathful Deities. Fifty-eight flame-crowned, fierce, blood-drinking figures will appear. Do not mistake them — they are none other than the Peaceful Deities you have already seen, now in changed aspect. They arise from different centers of your subtle body, wearing forms of wrath. Though they may not resemble the gentle Buddhas, they are the same wisdom appearing in fiercer guise.

In this Bardo, recognition becomes harder. Fear, awe, and terror cloud the mind. The soul passes through rounds of fainting and confusion. Yet paradoxically, liberation here can be easier: the sheer force of the visions awakens sharp attention. If even a little recognition arises, freedom is possible.

If you have never encountered these teachings, even vast knowledge of scriptures or mastery of philosophy cannot help you here. Many learned abbots and doctors of metaphysics, untrained in these esoteric truths, fail at this stage. Seeing fierce deities they never knew, they recoil in terror and fall into lower realms. But even the simplest devotee of the esoteric path, if they recognize these wrathful ones as their own guardians, will meet them as familiar friends.

Therefore, never despise the mystic path or those who follow it, even if they appear rough or unrefined. The least of its practitioners, having prayed, visualized, or even just glimpsed images of these deities, may recognize them in the Bardo and attain liberation. And signs will accompany their death — rainbow lights, relics in the ashes, fragrances in the air — because the wave of blessing in these teachings is strong.

This *Thödol* — the “Liberation by Hearing” — is indispensable. It is the very heart of the secret doctrine: liberation without meditation, freedom through hearing alone. Those touched by it cannot be drawn to unhappy states.

Thus, having completed the Peaceful cycle, you now face the Wrathful Deities. Their fierce forms arise not to harm, but to awaken. Recognition is the key.
