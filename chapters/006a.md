# Chapter 6: The Secondary Light

Beloved one, your own consciousness — radiant, open, inseparable from the Great Body of Light — has no birth and no death. It is the unchanging radiance, the Buddha Amitābha. To recognize this is enough.

Repeat this truth, again and again:
*Your mind is the Light. The Light is your mind. You are already the radiance of Buddhahood.*
Hearing these words clearly, three times or seven times, may awaken recognition. In that recognition, liberation is certain.

But if the first Light was not recognized, take heart: another dawn arises. This is the *Secondary Clear Light*, appearing after the breath has ceased.

Now, the mind emerges from the body. A thought arises: *“Am I dead, or am I not?”* You see your loved ones as before. You hear their voices and even their weeping. Yet something has changed — you are no longer bound by the body.

During this time, the soul should be called by name, and gently reminded:
*O noble soul, turn your mind toward the Light. Remember the instructions you have heard. Do not be distracted.*

If in life you had a sacred image or deity who guided your practice, bring it to mind now. Meditate upon your guide as though you see them clearly, like the reflection of the moon in water — visible, yet without substance. Hold steady, and rest your heart there.
