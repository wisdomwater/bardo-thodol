# Chapter 42: The Protection Against the Tormenting Furies

O nobly-born, though you may not wish it, karmic furies pursue from behind. Before you rise life-cutters, storms, darkness, and terrifying cries. Fear drives you to seek refuge.

You will see visions of mansions, caverns, forests, or lotus blossoms that close around you. Entering them, you may cling to them as safe refuge. Yet in so doing, you may take on an undesirable body and be bound to suffering. This is the interference of spirits and illusions.

At that time, visualize immediately the great protector: Heruka, or Hayagriva, or Vajrapani, or whichever tutelary deity you hold dear. See them vast, powerful, wrathful, and luminous — scattering every tormentor to dust. Their grace will shield you and grant the power to choose your rebirth wisely.

Know this also: the gods are born of the power of meditation, while unhappy spirits and demons arise from disturbed thoughts in the Intermediate State. As their minds became distorted, so their forms took shape.

Therefore, if you can, recollect the Great Teaching of the Void — all is empty. If not, train your mind to see all things as illusion, like a dream. If even this is beyond you, cling to nothing. Meditate on your tutelary deity, on the Great Compassionate One. Thus will Buddhahood be attained in the Sambhoga-Kāya.
