### What It Means

Here we are told the most profound truth: at death, every being meets the Light of Reality. It is not a gift reserved for saints, nor something to be earned — it is simply the nature of mind, unveiled when the body falls away.

The tragedy is not that people fail to meet it, but that they fail to recognize it. Just as the sun can shine but be ignored by eyes fixed on the ground, so too the Light can blaze without being noticed.

This is why repetition matters — the gentle persistence of loved ones reading these words, the steady reminder: *You are the Light.*

It is also why practice in life matters. Every moment we pause in silence, every time we rest in presence, we are rehearsing recognition. Dying does not create the Light — it simply uncovers what was always there.
