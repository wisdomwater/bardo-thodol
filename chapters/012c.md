### Reflection

Sit comfortably. Breathe slowly and picture a brilliant yellow light like the sun on a field of grain. Beside it is a muted blue-yellow glow that seems familiar and safe. Breathe and say quietly:

*When pride whispers, may I choose humility.*

*When the familiar calls me back, may I choose the greater Light.*

*May my heart take refuge in the wisdom that sees all things as equal,*

*and may I be led safely across the Bardo.*
