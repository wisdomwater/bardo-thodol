### Reflection

Let your jaw loosen, your brow smooth. With ease, whisper:

*Breathing in, I rest in the unborn.*

*Breathing out, I rest in the unceasing.*

*Breathing in, my mind is like water poured into water.*

*Breathing out, I am clear, vibrant, uncreated.*

*O Compassionate One,*

*let me not mistake form for substance,*

*nor fear for truth.*

*May I rest in the Clear Light,*

*where birth and death lose their hold,*

*and freedom shines without end.*
