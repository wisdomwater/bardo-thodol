# Chapter 1: The Great Doorway

Beloved one, listen with the ears of your heart.
There is a wisdom so vast it cannot be captured by words — the Boundless Light, the Divine Reality beyond form. To this Light we bow.

There is a wisdom that takes shape as kindness, appearing as peaceful and wrathful guides, who are none other than reflections of the truth within. To these guides we bow.

There is a wisdom that walks among us in human form, a protector who shows the way of freedom. To the teachers and guides who came before, we bow.

This teaching is called the *Great Liberation by Hearing*. It is medicine for the soul in the in-between states, when the body fades and the spirit is unmoored. Its purpose is freedom — not only for the wise, but for all who hear.

At the threshold of death, one is counseled to recognize the signs of departure: the body grows weak, the breath changes, the senses withdraw. These are not failures — they are signals of passage.

At that moment, remember this: consciousness itself may be set free by simply turning toward the truth. Some will find freedom through great intellect, some through practice, but for all — even for those of “ordinary wit” — this path can open the door.

### What It Means

The text begins with bowing — not as empty ritual, but as orientation. Before the vast mystery of death, we acknowledge what is greater than us: the Light beyond comprehension, the guides who embody compassion in countless forms, and the teachers who preserved this wisdom.

The promise is simple yet profound: *hearing truth can set one free.* Even at death, when all else falls away, remembering — even dimly — can bring release.

This opening also reassures us: liberation is not only for the saints or scholars. It is for the ordinary. For you. For me. The journey through the bardo is not a test to pass, but an invitation to listen, trust, and remember.

Close your eyes. Imagine standing at a doorway. Behind you is a familiar room — life, with all its joys and burdens. Before you lies a great horizon of light you cannot yet name.

Whisper within:
*When the thresholds of life come, may I not fear.
When the signs of change appear, may I remember the Light.
Liberation is not far, not reserved for the wise.
It is here, as close as my own hearing.*
