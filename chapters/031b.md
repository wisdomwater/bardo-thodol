### What It Means

This passage is one of the most practical of all the Bardo teachings. It reminds us that thought is destiny in the in-between. The mind, ungrounded by a physical body, is carried like a feather on the winds of karma. Every impulse of anger, clinging, or distrust shapes where we will land.

Even in life, we know this truth: our thoughts change our experience of the world. But here, thought is not just experience — it is creation. To be angry at one’s family, jealous of possessions, or scornful of imperfect rituals is to bind oneself to lower states. To cultivate trust, love, and surrender, even in confusion, is to open the way to freedom.

It is a teaching of immense compassion: you don’t need to be perfect, learned, or saintly. If you can remember devotion, affection, and prayer at this moment, it can carry you across.
