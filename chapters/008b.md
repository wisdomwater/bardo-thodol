### What It Means

This section prepares us for the most confusing part of the journey. After the clear dawn of the Light, the mind often drifts into a cascade of images and sensations — the very contents of one’s life and the echoes of habit.

Naming the six bardos is a compassionate map. It reassures the traveler that the current experience is one stage among many — not the final verdict. The repeated instruction to *not cling* is practical and gentle: attachment is the force that tethers consciousness back into cycles of becoming. The antidote is attention — steady, loving, and undistracted.
