# Chapter 3: The Signs of Departure

Beloved one, the moment has come. The breath is fading, the body loosens its hold, and you stand at the very threshold between worlds.

At this moment, a great radiance opens before you — the Clear Light, the essence of your own true nature. It is vast, luminous, unborn. Nothing can contain it. Nothing can harm it.

If you have practiced remembering this truth in life, then recognition will be easy. If not, do not fear. Even hearing these words now can stir your memory, reminding you of what you already carry within.

Let a trusted guide or a friend read these words near you, distinctly, with care. Their voice will be a mirror to help you see what is already present.

When the breath has ceased, the vital force gathers in the heart of wisdom. The knowing self shines for a moment, bright and clear. This is the opportunity. If you can rest in that recognition, you will be liberated into the radiant body of truth itself.

Therefore, hear these words:
*O noble soul, beloved one, the time has come to walk the path in reality. Your breathing is about to cease. The light you have glimpsed before is shining fully now. Do not fear. Do not turn away. Rest in the Light, and be free.*

### What It Means

The teaching here describes the *dissolution at death* — not as a tragedy, but as a moment of unveiling. When the senses close, the mind is revealed in its most naked form: luminous, clear, and vast.

This *Clear Light* is not foreign. It is the same essence we touch in deep meditation, in love, in awe before beauty. The difference at death is that all distractions fall away, leaving only the light itself.

The text reassures us that even if practice has been weak, even if memory falters, hearing the words in that moment can awaken recognition. It is a mercy: liberation is always possible, even at the last breath.

### Reflection

Sit quietly. Close your eyes. Imagine your last breath leaving the body, and in its place a great radiance dawning before you — not outside, but within. Say softly:

*When the time of death comes, may I remember the Light.*

*When fear arises, may I rest in trust.*

*The Light is not apart from me; it is my very being.*

*In that recognition, may I be free.*
