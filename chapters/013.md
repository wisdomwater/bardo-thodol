# Chapter 13: The Fourth Day — The Red Light of Amitābha

Beloved one, even if the path has been shown again and again, some still turn away. Old habits, vows broken, covetousness, and attachment cloud the vision. When clinging grips the heart, even the sounds and lights of wisdom may feel frightening.

On the Fourth Day, the red light of fire dawns. From the Western Realm of Bliss appears the Buddha Amitābha, radiant red, seated upon a peacock throne, holding the lotus of compassion, embraced by the Divine Mother Gökarmo. With them shine the bodhisattvas Chenrazee (Avalokiteśvara) and Jampal (Mañjuśrī), and the female companions Ghirdhima and Āloke — six radiant beings, surrounded by a rainbow halo of light.

From their heart streams the brilliant red light of Discriminating Wisdom, glittering, dazzling, bright beyond measure. It strikes directly into your heart, too radiant to gaze upon. Alongside it glimmers a dull, murky red glow: the light of the hungry ghosts, the Pretas, born of attachment and greed.

Because of clinging desire, you may shrink from the bright red brilliance and turn instead toward the softer, dull glow. But beware: that glow leads into the realm of craving and unquenchable thirst. There, endless hunger and longing await.

Therefore, listen well: Do not be afraid of the blazing red light. It is your own wisdom, shining. Recognize it, merge with it, and you will awaken. If recognition feels beyond you, then turn humbly to Amitābha, praying:

*Alas! Wandering in samsāra through the power of attachment,*

*On the radiant red path of Discriminating Wisdom,*

*May I be led by the Buddha Amitābha.*

*May the Divine Mother Gökarmo guard my back.*

*May I cross safely through the fearful ambush of the Bardo,*

*And awaken in the perfect Buddhahood of the Western Realm.*

### What It Means

This day reveals the danger of attachment. In life, craving and clinging distort perception; in the Bardo, they take shape as an almost irresistible pull toward the hungry ghost light.

The red light of Amitābha is not a threat but a gift. It is the wisdom that discerns each thing clearly, without confusion. It shows the uniqueness of every being, not to grasp at it, but to honor it. Yet, to the mind still bound by craving, this clarity can feel too intense, almost painful.

The dull red glow seems comforting, but it is the trap of desire itself. It pulls the soul into the realm of Pretas, where thirst and hunger are never satisfied. The teaching is blunt: turn away from it. Do not settle for the glow of craving when the radiance of liberation is before you.

Close your eyes. Picture before you two lights: one brilliant, dazzling red like the heart of a flame; the other dull, dim, and murky, whispering comfort.

Breathe and whisper:
*When craving calls me back, may I not be deceived.
When attachment stirs, may I let go.
May I walk into the blazing red light of wisdom,
And awaken in compassion’s embrace.*
