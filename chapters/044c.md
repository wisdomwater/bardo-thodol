### Reflection

Draw your attention to your heartbeat — the drum of life within you. Whisper:

*Breathing in, I release the old paths.*

*Breathing out, I open to a Pure Land.*

*Alas, I have wandered through countless lives.*

*Let my longing for freedom ripen now.*

*May I be born in the Pure Land of Amitābha,*

*or in whatever Realm is best for awakening.*

*Within a lotus of compassion may I arise,*

*in the presence of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,*

*free from defilement, ready to awaken.*

*I entrust myself wholly*

*to the Compassionate One.*
