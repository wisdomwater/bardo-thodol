### What It Means

This passage is a teaching in humility and discernment. If liberation has not been secured, we are guided to choose wisely where to return. Even the act of entering the womb can be done with clarity, compassion, and devotion.

The warning is clear: do not be fooled by appearances. What looks inviting may bind you to suffering; what seems difficult may actually be a doorway of blessing. The art is to release both attraction and repulsion, entering with neutrality. This is a profound practice even for daily life: to step into circumstances without clinging or aversion, but with steady presence.

Most importantly, this section reminds us to direct intention. Even if rebirth is inevitable, you can choose to dedicate it for the good of all beings. You can shape the trajectory of your return by aligning it with compassion and Dharma.
