### What It Means

This is the judgement scene of the Bardo. But unlike earthly trials, there is no external judge, no demon, no punisher. The Mirror of Karma is your own mind reflecting itself. The Good Genius and Evil Genius are your own tendencies becoming visible.

The terrifying visions — ropes, cutting, dismemberment — are symbolic of how our unhealed guilt and fear tear at us. In truth, you cannot die again; the Bardo body is mind, not matter. All these appearances arise from your own consciousness and cannot harm you.

Here the teaching is radical: if you simply recognize the terrifying forms as empty radiance — the Dharma-Kāya itself — you awaken instantly. The Four Kāyas are not distant heavens but the dimensions of your own mind. Even if you cannot meditate deeply, remembering your guru, the Compassionate One, or your own sacred name can anchor you in the light of recognition.

This is the turning point. If you look outward for a savior, you will wander. If you look inward and recognize, you are free.
