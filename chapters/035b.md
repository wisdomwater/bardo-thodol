### What It Means

The vision of couples in union represents the strongest pull of desire: the drive toward rebirth. In ordinary life, this energy is overwhelming; in the Bardo, it can sweep the soul into a new body without awareness.

The teaching is to *transform desire into reverence*. Instead of seeing parents-to-be, see the Guru and the Divine Mother. Instead of craving entry, bow down in devotion. This shift changes the energy from lust to faith, from attachment to offering.

The “boon” here is not a worldly gift but the grace of awakening: the power to remain free, or at least to be guided into a higher birth. By remembering to treat even this vision as sacred appearance, the cycle of bondage can be interrupted.
