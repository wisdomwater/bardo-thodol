### Reflection

Inhale peace, exhale striving. Let your heart form the words:

*Breathing in, I see desire arise.*

*Breathing out, I bow in reverence.*

*Breathing in, I offer devotion.*

*Breathing out, the womb-door closes.*

*O Guru, O Divine Mother,*

*when the visions of union draw me in,*

*let me not be overcome by craving.*

*Let me see You in every form,*

*and turn longing into worship.*

*May devotion replace desire,*

*and may the womb-door close before me.*
