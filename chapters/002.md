# Chapter 2: The Reading of the Words

If, at the moment of death, one is already liberated, there is no need for this book. But if not, then let these words be read with care and with love.

Let them be read clearly, distinctly, as though the one who has departed were sitting right here, listening. Even if the body is gone, sit where they once sat, and imagine their presence. Speak to them as if they are still near, because they are.

Let there be no wailing, no sorrowful outcry — for such sounds can confuse and disturb the spirit. Instead, let the room be still, filled with quiet compassion.

The reading may be done by a teacher, a trusted friend, or someone who held the heart of the departed. Let the words be spoken close to the ear, not as a formality, but as a whisper of guidance.

If offerings can be made, let them be offered. If not, let the offering be the heart’s devotion, infinite in its sincerity. Let prayers of good wishes be spoken, not once, but many times, invoking protection, safety, and courage.

Thus begins the *Great Liberation by Hearing*:

* first, to guide the soul at the moment of death,
* second, to set them face-to-face with Reality in the bardo,
* and third, to guide them safely when new birth approaches.

This section makes something clear: the *Thödol* is not just a text to be studied. It is a companion for the soul in passage. It is meant to be read aloud, with tenderness, as though love itself were speaking.

Notice how practical the instructions are: read distinctly, imagine the spirit listening, restrain tears. These are not about ritual for its own sake, but about creating a calm, supportive field so the soul can hear what it most needs.

There’s also a profound reminder: even if elaborate offerings are not possible, the heart’s intention is enough. Infinite devotion can be imagined and offered with the mind alone. Liberation does not depend on wealth, only sincerity.

Imagine you are reading words of comfort to someone you love — not only at death, but whenever they feel lost or afraid. Feel the care in your tone, the compassion in your heart. This is the essence of the *Thödol*: love spoken aloud.

Whisper this prayer:
*May I learn to speak words that liberate.
May I learn to comfort, not confuse.
When others pass through fear,
may my voice be a lamp that guides them home.*
