# Chapter 40: The Choosing of the Womb-Door

There are many who, though reminded and instructed, are not liberated — because of heavy karma, old habits of ignorance, and lack of devotion. If the womb-door has not been closed until now, then it is nearly time to assume another body.

Therefore, hear this teaching on the choosing of a womb.

O nobly-born, though you did not recognize the earlier teachings, you are now at the threshold of rebirth. Attend carefully. It is almost time to take form again. Choose wisely where to enter.
