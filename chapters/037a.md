# Chapter 37: The Fourth Method of Closing the Womb-Door

O nobly-born, if the womb-door is still not closed, then meditate on *The Untrue and the Illusory.*

Think thus:

“O, the father and mother, the black rain, the storm-blasts, the frightening sounds, the visions of form — these are illusions. They have no real substance. They are dreams, phantoms, echoes, mirages, images in water. They are non-permanent and without fixity. Why should I cling to them? Why should I fear them?

These are but hallucinations of my own mind. And the illusory mind itself has no foundation from eternity. Where then could these appearances exist?

Because I did not know this truth, I mistook the unreal for the real and wandered so long in the Sangsāra. If I still fail to recognize them as illusions, I shall wander on endlessly in suffering. But now I see: all is illusion. They cannot bind me.”

By holding firmly to this realization, the belief in their reality will dissolve. Imprinting this deeply on consciousness, the womb-door will close.
