# Chapter 30: The Judgement

O nobly-born, what you now experience arises from your own karma. No one else is doing this to you. Pray earnestly to the Three Jewels; they alone can protect you.

Your good deeds, counted by the Good Genius in white stones, and your harmful deeds, counted by the Evil Genius in black stones, appear before you. You may feel afraid and want to lie, but nothing is hidden. The Lord of Death consults the Mirror of Karma, where all your actions are reflected.

You may see ropes around your neck, or your body being cut, your heart removed, your brain licked, your blood drunk — but you cannot die. Even if you are hacked to pieces, your body reforms, because it is not flesh but mind.

Know this: the Lords of Death, the Furies, the Bull-Headed Spirits are your own hallucinations. They are forms of your desire-body — a body of propensities — and void. Voidness cannot harm voidness.

Now is the moment to recognize: you are in the Bardo. Meditate on the Great Symbol, or if you cannot, at least examine the nature of what frightens you. All these forms are in truth the bright, empty nature of the Dharma-Kāya. This Voidness is not nothingness, but the clear, radiant mind before which your awareness shines more lucidly.

This inseparable Voidness and Brightness is your own primordial mind — the Ādi-Kāya — radiant and unobstructed, expressing itself as the Sambhoga-Kāya and Nirmāna-Kāya. By simply recognizing this, you can awaken in any of the Four Kāyas. Do not be distracted.

This moment is decisive. “In a moment of time, a marked differentiation is created; in a moment of time, Perfect Enlightenment is obtained.” Even if you failed to recognize until now, you can still awaken here.

If you cannot meditate, at least remember the Compassionate One, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. Think of all fears and visions as your own tutelary deity, as the Compassionate One. Call to mind the sacred name given to you in life, and the name of your guru, and speak them to the Lord of Death. Even if you fall from precipices, you will not be harmed. Avoid awe and terror.

### What It Means

This is the judgement scene of the Bardo. But unlike earthly trials, there is no external judge, no demon, no punisher. The Mirror of Karma is your own mind reflecting itself. The Good Genius and Evil Genius are your own tendencies becoming visible.

The terrifying visions — ropes, cutting, dismemberment — are symbolic of how our unhealed guilt and fear tear at us. In truth, you cannot die again; the Bardo body is mind, not matter. All these appearances arise from your own consciousness and cannot harm you.

Here the teaching is radical: if you simply recognize the terrifying forms as empty radiance — the Dharma-Kāya itself — you awaken instantly. The Four Kāyas are not distant heavens but the dimensions of your own mind. Even if you cannot meditate deeply, remembering your guru, the Compassionate One, or your own sacred name can anchor you in the light of recognition.

This is the turning point. If you look outward for a savior, you will wander. If you look inward and recognize, you are free.

### Reflection

Take a slow breath in through your nose and feel your chest expand. Gently say:

*In the mirror of karma,*

*may I see only truth.*

*In the forms of terror,*

*may I see my own mind.*

*In the Lord of Death,*

*may I see the Compassionate One.*

*O Radiant Void,*

*O Bright Clear Mind,*

*hold me now.*

*May fear dissolve into recognition,*

*and recognition into freedom.*
