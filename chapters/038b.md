### What It Means

Here the teachings return us to the heart of the path: the Clear Light of mind itself. All other practices — rejecting fear, dissolving attraction and repulsion, recognizing illusions — culminate in this simple resting in awareness.

The metaphor is striking: *water poured into water.* Nothing to grasp, nothing to fix, nothing separate. Just the flow of mind merging with its own true nature.

This is not about forceful concentration, but a gentle return. The womb-door — the compulsion to take form again in the Sangsāra — closes not by resistance, but by recognition. When we see that mind is unborn, unceasing, and radiant, rebirth loosens its grip.
