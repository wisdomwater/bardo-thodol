### What It Means

The Wrathful Deities intensify here, arising from the Vajra family — the lineage of clarity, diamond-like wisdom, and indestructibility. They seem terrifying: dark blue, blood-drinking, surrounded by symbols of death and power. Yet the teaching insists: they are not alien beings. They are your own mind’s wisdom, shining in fierce form.

The skull-bowls, axes, and flames symbolize the cutting away of delusion, pride, and fear. These are not punishments, but tools of liberation. The blood-drinking imagery is meant to show how even death itself is consumed by awareness.

The challenge is simple but profound: to look upon what terrifies you and see it as your own essence. If you recognize Vajra-Heruka as your own inner light, the terrifying dissolves into the liberating.
