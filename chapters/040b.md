### What It Means

This moment is tender and weighty: if liberation has not been realized, rebirth becomes inevitable. Yet even here, the teachings remind us that choice is possible. Not all womb-doors are the same — some lead into deeper suffering, others into more favorable conditions for awakening.

The force of karma propels the soul, but the light of awareness can still guide it. The instruction is not to fall into despair but to *choose with mindfulness*. To see the threshold as another moment of practice, another opportunity to align with compassion, clarity, and the path toward awakening.

The text also reflects a deep mercy: even if liberation has not come, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas surround the soul, still offering guidance. The Refuge can be renewed, and the mind steadied for its next journey.
