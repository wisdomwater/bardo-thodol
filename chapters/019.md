# Chapter 19: The Eighth Day — The Dawning of Heruka

Beloved one, listen well and without distraction. Having not recognized the Peaceful Deities, you have wandered further, and now the Wrathful Deities appear. On this day, the Great Glorious Buddha-Heruka dawns before you.

He is dark brown in color, with three fierce heads — white on the right, red on the left, and dark at the center. Nine eyes blaze wide open, glaring with power. His eyebrows flash like lightning, his fangs gleam as he utters the fierce cries of “a-la-la” and “ha-ha,” and whistles shrill and piercing. His reddish-yellow hair stands upright, flaming with radiance. Upon his heads rest skulls, the sun, and the moon. Around his neck hangs a garland of serpents and severed heads.

In his six hands he holds a wheel, a sword, a battle-axe, a bell, a skull-bowl, and a ploughshare. Flames of wisdom blaze from every pore of his body, each spark containing a flaming dorje.

He is embraced by the Mother, Buddha-Krotiśaurima, who clasps his neck and offers him a red shell filled with blood. Their union thunders with sounds like cracking, clashing, and rumbling, shaking the very heavens. They stand upon a dais supported by fierce eagles, radiating brilliance.

O noble soul, fear not. Do not shrink away. This is not an enemy, but your own mind’s wisdom revealed. Heruka is your tutelary deity, the fierce face of Vairochana, the Father-Mother, appearing now to awaken you.

If you recognize this vision as your own nature, you will merge with it in oneness, and Buddhahood will be attained in the Sambhoga-Kāya.

### What It Means

The dawning of Heruka marks the first of the Wrathful Deities cycle. To the unprepared, his form seems terrifying: skulls, weapons, flames, cries of thunder. Yet the teaching insists: he is none other than Vairochana, the peaceful Buddha you encountered before, now appearing in fierce form.

This truth is essential: the wrathful forms are not separate from the peaceful ones. They are two faces of the same wisdom. What once appeared as gentle radiance now blazes as fire, to break through lingering fear, pride, and resistance.

In life, too, wisdom sometimes comes gently, sometimes fiercely. Compassion may comfort, or it may roar, shaking us from delusion. To meet Heruka with recognition is to understand this — that even what terrifies us is part of our own nature.

### Reflection


Close your eyes. Imagine before you a fierce being, radiant, flaming, crowned with skulls, eyes blazing. Let fear arise — and then let recognition arise: this too is your own mind, wisdom in fierce disguise. Whisper softly:

*Peaceful or wrathful, gentle or fierce,*

*all are the play of my own true mind.*

*I will not fear. I will not turn away.*

*In recognition, I am free.*
