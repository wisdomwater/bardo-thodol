### What It Means

This section makes something clear: the *Thödol* is not just a text to be studied. It is a companion for the soul in passage. It is meant to be read aloud, with tenderness, as though love itself were speaking.

Notice how practical the instructions are: read distinctly, imagine the spirit listening, restrain tears. These are not about ritual for its own sake, but about creating a calm, supportive field so the soul can hear what it most needs.

There’s also a profound reminder: even if elaborate offerings are not possible, the heart’s intention is enough. Infinite devotion can be imagined and offered with the mind alone. Liberation does not depend on wealth, only sincerity.
