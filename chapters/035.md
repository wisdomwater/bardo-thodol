## The Second Method of Closing the Womb-Door

O nobly-born, at this time you may see visions of men and women in union. If you see them, do not be drawn into the space between them.

Instead, regard the father and mother you see as the form of your Guru and the Divine Mother. Bow before them. With humility, offer them your devotion and mental worship, and resolve that you will ask them for spiritual guidance.

This alone can close the womb-door. But if it does not, and you find yourself still ready to enter, then meditate upon the Guru Father-Mother as you would upon your tutelary deity, or upon the Compassionate Lord and His Consort. Worship them inwardly with offerings of the mind, and resolve earnestly that you will ask of them a boon. By this resolve, the womb-door will be closed.

### What It Means

The vision of couples in union represents the strongest pull of desire: the drive toward rebirth. In ordinary life, this energy is overwhelming; in the Bardo, it can sweep the soul into a new body without awareness.

The teaching is to *transform desire into reverence*. Instead of seeing parents-to-be, see the Guru and the Divine Mother. Instead of craving entry, bow down in devotion. This shift changes the energy from lust to faith, from attachment to offering.

The “boon” here is not a worldly gift but the grace of awakening: the power to remain free, or at least to be guided into a higher birth. By remembering to treat even this vision as sacred appearance, the cycle of bondage can be interrupted.

*Breathing in, I see desire arise.
Breathing out, I bow in reverence.
Breathing in, I offer devotion.
Breathing out, the womb-door closes.*

*O Guru, O Divine Mother,
when the visions of union draw me in,
let me not be overcome by craving.
Let me see You in every form,
and turn longing into worship.
May devotion replace desire,
and may the womb-door close before me.*
