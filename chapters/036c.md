### Reflection

Let your eyes close halfway, as if seeing the world through grace. Gently speak:

*Breathing in, I see attraction arise.*

*Breathing out, I release it.*

*Breathing in, I see aversion arise.*

*Breathing out, I let it go.*

*O Compassionate One,*

*teach me to see the root of my wandering.*

*When I am pulled by love or hate,*

*let me remember the deeper truth.*

*Let my heart rest in pure devotion.*

*Let the womb-door close,*

*and may freedom be born within me.*
