# Chapter 29: The Sidpa Bardo – Characteristics of Existence

O nobly-born, in this state you may see your family and your home. You may try to speak, but no one replies. Then sorrow comes, as you think: *“I am dead! What shall I do?”*

You are carried by the winds of karma, with no place to rest, drifting like a feather in a storm. Around you is a twilight that never changes. This wandering may last up to seven weeks, though most remain about twenty-two days, depending on karma.

Terrifying visions appear—darkness, storms, demons, collapsing mountains, floods, and fire. Voices cry, *“Strike! Slay!”* In your fear, you may see great abysses before you—white, red, and black. They are not real precipices but the powers of Anger, Lust, and Ignorance.

Some will experience joy and ease, others only dull indifference. Those of heavy karma will face terror. But all these visions are nothing more than the radiance of your own mind.

Longing for a body may arise. You may try to return to your corpse, but it is too late. It has decayed, or been burned, or given to the birds. Feeling trapped and without rest, you are drawn by desire to seek a new body. This is the suffering of the Sidpa Bardo.

Put aside the craving for flesh. Rest the mind in the clear awareness of its own nature. Call upon your guru and the Compassionate Ones. In stillness and surrender, liberation is possible even now.
