### Reflection

Allow your breath to deepen, carrying kindness inward. Quietly say:

*Breathing in, I open to choice.*

*Breathing out, I rest in freedom.*

*O Compassionate One,*

*when doors appear before me,*

*grant me discernment.*

*May I not rush in fear,*

*nor cling in desire.*

*May I choose with clarity,*

*guided by love.*

*If rebirth awaits,*

*let it be in a place of awakening.*

*If liberation calls,*

*may I recognize it*

*and rest in the Pure Land.*
