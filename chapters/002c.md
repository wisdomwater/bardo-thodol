### Reflection

Imagine you are reading words of comfort to someone you love — not only at death, but whenever they feel lost or afraid. Feel the care in your tone, the compassion in your heart. This is the essence of the *Thödol*: love spoken aloud. Whisper this prayer:

*May I learn to speak words that liberate.*

*May I learn to comfort, not confuse.*

*When others pass through fear,*

*may my voice be a lamp that guides them home.*
