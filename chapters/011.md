# Chapter 11: The Second Day — The White Light of Vajrasattva

Beloved one, if you could not recognize the blue light of Vairochana, another chance now arises. On the Second Day, a new radiance dawns.

From the deep-blue Eastern Realm of Supreme Happiness appears Vajrasattva — also known as Akṣobhya — blue in color, seated upon an elephant throne, holding the five-pronged dorje of unshakable truth, embraced by the Mother Māmakī. With them are four attendants: the bodhisattvas Kṣitigarbha and Maitreya, and the female bodhisattvas Lasema and Puṣhpema. Six radiant beings surround you with compassion.

From their heart shines the brilliant white light of Mirror-like Wisdom — dazzling, transparent, impossible to look upon directly, yet pure and liberating. Alongside it, another light appears: a dull, smoky glow, the path of hell born from anger.

Because of old habits, you may shrink from the radiant white light, startled by its brilliance, and instead feel a strange pull toward the smoky haze. Do not be deceived. That haze is the snare of anger; if you follow it, you will fall into the suffering worlds of hell.

Instead, hear these words: Do not fear the dazzling white light. It is the grace of Vajrasattva shining upon you. Rest in it with faith and humility, and pray:

*Alas! Wandering in the cycle of birth and death through violent anger,*

*May I be led by the radiant white path of Mirror-like Wisdom.*

*May the Bhagavān Vajrasattva shine before me,*

*May the Divine Mother Māmakī guard my back.*

*May I cross safely the fearful ambush of the Bardo,*

*And awaken into the All-Perfect Buddhahood of the Eastern Realm.*

Pray thus with your whole heart, and you will merge into the rainbow radiance of Vajrasattva, attaining freedom in the realm of joy.

This stage reveals the pull of anger. The teaching shows how destructive habits appear not only in life, but after death. Anger clouds the vision and makes the soul recoil from the brilliance of truth. Out of fear, we may choose what feels easier — the smoky, familiar light — even if it leads to suffering.

The instruction is clear: resist the pull of anger. Do not shrink from brilliance. The white light of Vajrasattva is Mirror-like Wisdom — the truth that all things reflect without distortion when seen clearly. To rest in that wisdom is to see reality as it is, beyond judgment or reaction.

The image of Vajrasattva with his companions is meant to steady the mind. Surrounded by these compassionate presences, the soul is not alone. Their light is not to be feared, but embraced.

Take a breath and remember a time when anger made you recoil from truth, preferring something easier but less true.

Whisper within:
*When anger clouds my vision, may I not turn away.
When smoky shadows tempt me, may I not be deceived.
May I rest in the radiant white light of wisdom,
And awaken into clarity and peace.*
