### What It Means

This passage shows us how the very energies of love and hate, when left unexamined, can bind us into existence after existence. Attraction and repulsion are two sides of the same coin, and both lead to bondage.

The practice is radical: to pause in the moment of strongest pull — even at the threshold of rebirth — and name the pattern: *This is attraction. This is aversion. I will not follow them.* By doing so, one redirects the flow of karma and reclaims freedom.

The essence is to replace grasping and rejection with steadiness and devotion. The teaching assures us that a single, undistracted resolve can close the door to rebirth and open the way to liberation.
