### What It Means

This first encounter with the Peaceful Deities is the pattern for all that follow: a dazzling light of truth appears side by side with a softer, karmically conditioned light. The blazing light is liberation; the soft light is seduction into rebirth.

The text warns us of our usual tendencies. We are often afraid of what is vast, bright, and overwhelming, and instead choose the comfortable and familiar, even if it keeps us bound. Here, the soul must learn to turn toward what feels too intense — the radiance of awakening — and resist the pull of comfort that leads back into cycles of suffering.

Vairochana represents the wisdom of the dharmadhātu — the truth that all things arise and dissolve within the infinite space of being. To recognize this wisdom is to recognize the ground of reality itself.
