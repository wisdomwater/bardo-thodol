# Chapter 30: The Judgement

O nobly-born, what you now experience arises from your own karma. No one else is doing this to you. Pray earnestly to the Three Jewels; they alone can protect you.

Your good deeds, counted by the Good Genius in white stones, and your harmful deeds, counted by the Evil Genius in black stones, appear before you. You may feel afraid and want to lie, but nothing is hidden. The Lord of Death consults the Mirror of Karma, where all your actions are reflected.

You may see ropes around your neck, or your body being cut, your heart removed, your brain licked, your blood drunk — but you cannot die. Even if you are hacked to pieces, your body reforms, because it is not flesh but mind.

Know this: the Lords of Death, the Furies, the Bull-Headed Spirits are your own hallucinations. They are forms of your desire-body — a body of propensities — and void. Voidness cannot harm voidness.

Now is the moment to recognize: you are in the Bardo. Meditate on the Great Symbol, or if you cannot, at least examine the nature of what frightens you. All these forms are in truth the bright, empty nature of the Dharma-Kāya. This Voidness is not nothingness, but the clear, radiant mind before which your awareness shines more lucidly.

This inseparable Voidness and Brightness is your own primordial mind — the Ādi-Kāya — radiant and unobstructed, expressing itself as the Sambhoga-Kāya and Nirmāna-Kāya. By simply recognizing this, you can awaken in any of the Four Kāyas. Do not be distracted.

This moment is decisive. “In a moment of time, a marked differentiation is created; in a moment of time, Perfect Enlightenment is obtained.” Even if you failed to recognize until now, you can still awaken here.

If you cannot meditate, at least remember the Compassionate One, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. Think of all fears and visions as your own tutelary deity, as the Compassionate One. Call to mind the sacred name given to you in life, and the name of your guru, and speak them to the Lord of Death. Even if you fall from precipices, you will not be harmed. Avoid awe and terror.
