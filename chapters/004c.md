### Reflection

Close your eyes and imagine a sky without clouds, endless and clear. Imagine your own mind as that sky — open, spacious, radiant. Whisper softly:

*The Light is my nature.*

*It is always here.*

*When death comes, may I remember.*

*When fear comes, may I rest in the sky of my own being.*
