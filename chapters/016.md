# Chapter 16: The Seventh Day — The Four Wisdom Lights

Beloved one, now the radiances grow more glorious still. Orbs of blue light appear, shining like inverted turquoise cups, each surrounded by smaller orbs and starry sparks, until the whole expanse glimmers like a sky of jewels. This is the Dharma-Dhātu Wisdom itself, the vast wisdom of space.

From the heart of Vajrasattva streams the brilliant white light of Mirror-like Wisdom, dazzling, transparent, radiant, each orb like a pure mirror reflecting truth.

From the heart of Ratnasambhava pours the golden yellow light of the Wisdom of Equality, like inverted golden cups glowing with brilliance.

From the heart of Amitābha blazes the red light of Discriminating Wisdom, shining like coral cups, dazzling, glorious, bright as fire itself.

All these lights shine upon your heart together.

O noble soul, remember: these are not foreign lights. They are your own faculties, your own inner wisdoms, now revealed. Do not be frightened. Do not cling. Rest in stillness. If you abide without distraction, these lights will merge into you, and you will awaken into Buddhahood.

The green light of All-Performing Wisdom does not yet appear, for that faculty is not yet fully developed. What you see now are called the Four Wisdom Lights, the union of wisdom that opens the inner path.

If you recognize them as your own radiance — as a child recognizes its mother — then you will enter tranquil Samādhi, merging into the body of perfect intellect, free beyond return.

But beware: along with these wisdom lights appear the dull lights of the six realms — the pale glow of the gods, the murky green of the asuras, the dim yellow of humans, the shadowy blue of animals, the dusky red of hungry ghosts, the smoky darkness of hell. These, too, will shine beside the wisdom lights. Do not be lured by them. Do not fear them. Rest in stillness, and you will not be bound.

This day is the culmination of the Peaceful Deities cycle. All the lights now blaze together — not sequentially, but in union. The teaching makes it plain: every light of wisdom is your own mind, appearing in radiant form. The challenge is to recognize this truth instead of being pulled by the dull lights of old karmic habits.

The six dull lights are particularly dangerous because they feel familiar. Each one corresponds to a realm of existence shaped by attachment, anger, pride, jealousy, or ignorance. To follow them is to be pulled back into rebirth. To resist their pull — and to recognize the brilliant lights as your own nature — is to be liberated.

The image of recognition “as a son knows his mother” is deeply tender. It means that awakening here is not about straining or achieving, but about remembering — recognizing what has always been yours.

Close your eyes. Imagine brilliant lights of blue, white, yellow, and red shining together, dazzling in their radiance. Beside them, dimmer glows flicker, familiar but heavy.

Whisper softly:
*These brilliant lights are my own nature.*

*These dim glows are only shadows of habit.*

*May I not be afraid, nor be deceived.*

*May I recognize the wisdom within me,*

*As a child recognizes its mother.*

*In that recognition, may I be free.*
