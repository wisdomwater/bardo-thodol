### Reflection

Feel the space between your breaths widen. Let your soul speak:

*Breathing in, I remember there is always a way home.*

*Breathing out, I rest in the embrace of compassion.*

*Even if I stumble, may I be guided.*

*Even if I forget, may I be reminded.*

*Even if I fall, may I rise again,*

*drawn upward by the Light.*

*May I carry this hope into my life now,*

*so that at the hour of death,*

*I will not be afraid,*

*but recognize the Radiance*

*and walk in peace.*
