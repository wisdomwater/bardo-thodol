# Chapter 23: The Twelfth Day — Karma-Heruka Appears

O beloved one, listen well. On this day, the blood-drinking deities of the Karmic (Action) Order appear.

From the northern quarter of your mind arises Karma-Heruka, dark green and majestic. He has three faces — white, red, and green — and six powerful arms. In his right hands he holds a sword, a trident-staff, and a club. In his left hands he holds a bell, a skull-bowl brimming with blood, and a ploughshare. His four legs stand firm and unshakable.

He is embraced by Karma-Krotishaurima, the Mother, who clasps his neck with one hand and offers him a red shell filled with blood with the other. Father and Mother together radiate fierce power, shining forth from the northern quarter of your brain.

Do not be afraid. Do not shrink back. Recognize them as the embodiment of your own mind. They are your tutelary deities, the guardians of your own being. In truth they are Amogha-Siddhi, the Buddha of All-Accomplishing Wisdom, appearing in wrathful form. If you recognize this, liberation is immediate.

Just as one who mistakes a lion’s skin for a real lion trembles in fear — until told the truth — so too these terrifying visions dissolve when you recognize them as your own thought-forms. They are not strangers; they are your own wisdom returning to you in a fierce disguise. When you see this clearly, the Clear Light of your mind unites with the Clear Light of Reality, and awakening dawns.
