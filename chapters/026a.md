# Chapter 26: The Lord of Death and the Final Wrathful Vision

O beloved one, on this day the Lord of Death and his terrifying host will arise. They will fill the worlds with dreadful forms:

* Faces grimacing, upper teeth biting down upon the lower lip.
* Eyes glazed, hair bound high upon the head.
* Bodies big-bellied yet narrow-waisted, brandishing karmic record-boards.
* They shout “Strike! Slay!” while drinking blood, tearing hearts from corpses, and licking the brains of the dead.

But remember: these are your own thought-forms. The body you now bear is a body of mind, made only of karmic propensities. It cannot be harmed or slain, for it is voidness itself. Void cannot destroy void.

Therefore, do not fear. All these figures — peaceful and wrathful deities, gods and demons, terrifying visions, and radiant lights — are not external realities. They are emanations of your own mind, and they vanish the moment you recognize them as such.

At this moment, recall your tutelary deity and pray with faith:

*“Alas! I wander in the Bardo. O Precious Guide, run to my aid!
Do not let your grace forsake me.”*

Pray also to your guru, and to the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones, offering these words:

*“Alas! when I wander in the Bardo, overcome by illusions,*

*On the light-path of abandoning fear and awe,*

*May the bands of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones lead me,*

*May the goddess Rich in Space guard my rear,*

*May I be saved from ambush and placed among the Buddhas.”*

Pray with faith that the terrifying sounds become the sacred Six Syllables of liberation. Pray that the Five Elements rise not as enemies but as radiant expressions of the Five Wisdoms.

If you do this, all fear dissolves, and liberation in the Sambhoga-Kāya becomes certain.

But if recognition still does not occur, then the soul begins to move further into the third Bardo, the Sidpa Bardo, the realm of rebirth.
