### Reflection

Place your hand over your heart. Imagine a great being of golden-yellow light, fierce and radiant, offering you both fire and treasure. Breathe gently and whisper:

*This is my mind in its jewel form.*

*This is abundance without clinging.*

*I will not fear. I will recognize.*

*In recognition, I am free.*
