# Chapter 24: The Thirteenth Day — The Kerimas and Htamenmas

O beloved one, listen without distraction. On this day, if you have not yet recognized the Peaceful or Wrathful Fathers, new visions will arise. From the eastern quarter of your mind, the Eight Kerimas appear — fierce dakinis, guardians of the directions, each bearing terrifying symbols.

* From the east: the **White Kerima**, wielding a corpse as a club and holding a skull-bowl of blood.
* From the south: the **Yellow Tseurima**, aiming a bow and arrow.
* From the west: the **Red Pramoha**, carrying a banner topped with a makara.
* From the north: the **Black Petali**, holding a vajra and a skull-bowl of blood.
* From the southeast: the **Red Pukkase**, grasping intestines in one hand and raising them to her mouth.
* From the southwest: the **Dark-Green Ghasmarī**, stirring a skull-bowl of blood with a vajra and drinking it with relish.
* From the northwest: the **Yellow-White Tsandhali**, tearing apart a corpse, holding its heart and devouring its flesh.
* From the northeast: the **Dark-Blue Smasha**, likewise tearing and eating.

These eight surround the Five Wrathful Fathers. Do not fear them.

Then, from the outer circle, the Eight Htamenmas appear, animal-headed guardians, also fierce and blood-drinking:

* The **Lion-headed One**, brown, shaking her mane, corpse in her mouth.
* The **Tiger-headed One**, red, fangs bared, eyes bulging.
* The **Fox-headed One**, black, eating entrails with relish.
* The **Wolf-headed One**, blue, tearing apart a corpse with glaring eyes.
* The **Vulture-headed One**, pale, carrying a corpse on her shoulder.
* The **Cemetery-bird-headed One**, dark red, also bearing a corpse.
* The **Crow-headed One**, black, sword and skull-bowl in hand, eating heart and lungs.
* The **Owl-headed One**, dark blue, holding vajra and skull-bowl, devouring.

All of these issue from within your own brain, surrounding the Wrathful Fathers. They are not demons from outside, but the unrecognized thought-forms of your own mind. Know this, and fear them not.

### What It Means

Here the fierce dakinis appear — wild, blood-drinking, animal-headed. Their horrifying forms are not punishments, but expressions of the raw power of the psyche. They represent passions, instincts, and propensities that, when unrecognized, appear as monstrous forces.

The teaching insists: *They are your own mind.* Just as in dreams, terrifying figures may chase you until you wake to realize you are dreaming, these wrathful figures dissolve when recognized as inner projections.

The Kerimas and Htamenmas embody untamed energies: hunger, rage, lust, primal survival drives. By recognizing them as your own thought-forms, you liberate their power into wisdom. By fearing or fleeing them, you fall deeper into delusion.

Close your eyes and breathe. Imagine all the terrifying figures of your own fears, instincts, and shadows arising. Whisper:
*Fierce dakinis of my mind,
I recognize you.
You are not enemies,
but my own strength in disguise.
I will not fear you.
I welcome you back into the light.*
