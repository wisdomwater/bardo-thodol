## The Choosing of the Womb-Door

There are many who, though reminded and instructed, are not liberated — because of heavy karma, old habits of ignorance, and lack of devotion. If the womb-door has not been closed until now, then it is nearly time to assume another body.

Therefore, hear this teaching on the choosing of a womb.

O nobly-born, though you did not recognize the earlier teachings, you are now at the threshold of rebirth. Attend carefully. It is almost time to take form again. Choose wisely where to enter.

This moment is tender and weighty: if liberation has not been realized, rebirth becomes inevitable. Yet even here, the teachings remind us that choice is possible. Not all womb-doors are the same — some lead into deeper suffering, others into more favorable conditions for awakening.

The force of karma propels the soul, but the light of awareness can still guide it. The instruction is not to fall into despair but to *choose with mindfulness*. To see the threshold as another moment of practice, another opportunity to align with compassion, clarity, and the path toward awakening.

The text also reflects a deep mercy: even if liberation has not come, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas surround the soul, still offering guidance. The Refuge can be renewed, and the mind steadied for its next journey.

*Breathing in, I stand at the threshold.
Breathing out, I choose with wisdom.
Breathing in, I remember the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.
Breathing out, I trust their guidance.*

*O Compassionate Ones,
if I must take form again,
let it be where love may grow,
where the Dharma may be heard,
and where wisdom can awaken.
Even in rebirth,
may I be turned toward the Light.*
