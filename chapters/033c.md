### Reflection

Rest your hands in your lap and feel the warmth of being alive. Say softly:

*Breathing in, I remember the Compassionate One.*

*Breathing out, I close the door to illusion.*

*Breathing in, storms and terrors arise.*

*Breathing out, I rest in the Clear Light.*

*O Compassionate One,*

*when winds drive me,*

*when womb-doors appear before me,*

*let me not be carried by desire.*

*Let me not mistake illusion for refuge.*

*Turn me back into Your embrace,*

*the unborn, unending radiance.*

*May I awaken here,*

*before the chains of birth close upon me again.*
