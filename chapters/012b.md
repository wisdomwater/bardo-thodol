### What It Means

This day shows a familiar theme in the Bardo: liberation requires not only seeing the Light, but *choosing* it over habit. Ratna-Sambhava’s yellow radiance represents the wisdom that sees equality — the way things feel, touch, and interrelate without exaggeration, without pride. Pride, however, disguises itself as a kind of worthiness that clings to identity; it can make us prefer a lesser, familiar comfort to the greater truth.

The text offers a practical remedy: either recognize the light as your own mind, or intentionally take refuge in it as a compassionate other. Either way, humility and focused trust are the keys. This is not intellectual humility alone but a heart-level loosening of the ego’s grip.

The danger of choosing the human light is literal: it draws you back into birth, age, sickness, and death — the whole cycle you sought freedom from. The teaching is urgent because these choices, once made, have consequences.
