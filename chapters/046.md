## The General Conclusion

Those who are well-practiced may not even need to pass through the Intermediate State at all — they will rise straight upward, liberated at the moment of death. Others, a little less practiced, may recognize the Clear Light or one of the Deities in the first two weeks, and so be freed.

For those of heavier karma, there are still many “turning points,” many rungs of the ladder, where recognition may happen. Even the weakest, if they hear this Teaching, can find refuge and turn from misery toward a human birth where Dharma may be practiced again.

This is why this Thödol is read at the bedside of the dying and to the departed. For in the Bardo the mind is clear, sensitive, and easily influenced. A single reminder can turn the heart toward liberation. The words need only be heard — even imperfectly, even without full comprehension — and they take root.

Therefore, let it be read. Let no one despair. Even those with the heaviest burdens of karma can be lifted. Let no one say, “It is too late.” This Teaching is the great bridge, carrying us across.

### What It Means

The conclusion is a reminder of hope and mercy. The path through the Bardos is not a single doorway but many. At each stage there is another chance to recognize, to turn, to be freed. The text itself is a compassionate companion: it liberates by being heard, by being remembered, even by being seen.

For the living, the message is clear: prepare now, while breath still fills the body. Commit the teachings to memory, let them shape the heart. But also, know this: even if you feel unready, even if you falter, compassion still pursues you into death. *There is always another chance.*

This is the great promise: no one is abandoned. However far one falls, the Divine Light seeks us out.

### Reflection


Feel the space between your breaths widen. Let your soul speak:


*Breathing in, I remember there is always a way home.*

*Breathing out, I rest in the embrace of compassion.*


*Even if I stumble, may I be guided.*

*Even if I forget, may I be reminded.*

*Even if I fall, may I rise again,*

*drawn upward by the Light.*


*May I carry this hope into my life now,*

*so that at the hour of death,*

*I will not be afraid,*

*but recognize the Radiance*

*and walk in peace.*
