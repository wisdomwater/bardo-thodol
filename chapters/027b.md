### What It Means

This conclusion reminds us that the practice of recognition is the heart of liberation. Meditation, visualization, devotion — all prepare the mind to meet the ultimate test: can we recognize our own mind as the source of light, deities, and visions at death?

The teaching also insists that compassion is practical: reading the text for others — the sick, the dying, even the dead — plants seeds of awakening. The words themselves hold power, especially in the heightened clarity of the Bardo.

And it comforts us: even if our lives have been tangled with mistakes, even if we have committed terrible wrongs, this teaching offers a path of liberation. Recognition can arise in a single moment.
