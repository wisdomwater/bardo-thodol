# Chapter 31: The All-Determining Influence of Thought

O nobly-born, know this: in the Bardo your thoughts carry immense weight. A single impulse of anger or clinging can pull you into the lower realms, while a single impulse of trust and devotion can lift you to liberation.

You will feel momentary joys and sorrows, as sharp and sudden as a catapult. Do not cling to the joys, nor resist the sorrows.

You may see your relatives performing rituals, sacrifices, or prayers on your behalf. Their actions may appear imperfect to your perception, and anger may arise: *“They are failing me, they are careless.”* Resist this thought, for it can drag you into hellish states. Instead, think: *“My own mind is clouded. I take refuge in the Three Jewels and entrust all to them.”*

You may feel attachment to the possessions you left behind, or resentment seeing them enjoyed by others. Let go of that. You cannot possess them now. Instead, dedicate them inwardly to the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. In release, there is freedom.

Know that even if the rituals for you are performed with flaws, your love and trust can transform them into true offerings. But resentment will poison them and bind you to suffering. Therefore, cultivate pure affection, humble faith, and impartial love.

Above all, remember: in this state your mind is weightless and quick. Whatever thought arises now has great power to shape your rebirth. Let devotion, not anger, be your guide.
