# Chapter 22: The Eleventh Day — Padma-Heruka Appears

O beloved one, listen well. On this day, the blood-drinking deities of the Lotus, or Padma, Order will appear.

From the western quarter of your own mind arises Padma-Heruka, radiant and fierce, his body a deep reddish-black. He has three faces: the right white, the left blue, and the central a dark red. He stands with four strong legs and wields six hands: one holds a lotus, another a trident-staff, another a club; the left hands hold a bell, a skull-bowl brimming with blood, and a small drum.

He is embraced by Padma-Krotiśaurima, the Mother, who clasps his neck with one hand and offers a red shell filled with blood with the other. Father and Mother together blaze forth from the western quarter of your brain, shining directly before you.

Do not fear them. Do not turn away in terror. Rejoice instead, for they are not enemies but the living radiance of your own mind. They are your tutelary deities, and in truth they are none other than Amitābha, the Buddha of Infinite Light, appearing in their wrathful form. Recognize this, and liberation is yours in the very moment of recognition.

### What It Means

The Lotus family is tied to love, compassion, and discernment. Amitābha represents the boundless light of compassion that shines upon all beings. In peaceful form he holds the lotus of purity; in wrathful form as Padma-Heruka, that compassion blazes like fire, breaking through attachments and illusions.

The skull-bowl, trident, and drum are not threats, but reminders that love and compassion cut through ego, stir the heart awake, and dissolve the illusions of separation. Even what appears terrifying is only the fierce face of mercy.

The challenge here is to recognize love in its fiercest guise. When compassion burns hot, it can feel overwhelming, even frightening. But this fire is your own true nature, calling you home. To embrace it is to merge with Amitābha, to realize that infinite light is none other than your own awakened mind.

Close your eyes and imagine a deep red lotus blazing with fire. From it shines a radiant being of fierce compassion. 

Breathe into the heart, and whisper:
*This fierce love is my own.
This burning fire is compassion.
I will not fear. I will recognize.
In recognition, I am free.*
