### What It Means

This introduction reminds us that awakening comes in many forms. For some, the gentle radiance of Peaceful Deities is enough. For others, fiercer methods are needed — wisdom wearing terrifying masks. The wrathful forms are not punishments. They are the same compassion, clothed in fire, to break through fear, pride, and ignorance.

The text also warns against relying on outer learning alone. Intellectual study, even vast, is no substitute for direct recognition. Spiritual pride or disdain for esoteric practices leaves the soul unprepared for these visions. By contrast, even the humblest practice — devotion, a prayer, a moment of recognition — can open the door to liberation.

The essence is trust. Trust that all appearances, no matter how fierce, are your own wisdom showing itself.
