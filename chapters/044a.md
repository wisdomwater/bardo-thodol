# Chapter 44: Supernormal Birth by Transference to a Paradise Realm

O nobly-born, if you choose transference to a Pure Land, meditate thus:

“Alas! Through countless aeons I have wandered in the quagmire of samsara, blind to my true nature, circling in birth and death. How painful that I have not yet been liberated into Buddhahood!

Now I am sickened and horrified by this endless wandering. The time has come to flee. I resolve to be born in the Happy Western Realm, at the feet of Buddha Amitābha, miraculously within a lotus blossom.”

Think this with one-pointed resolve. Or, if you prefer another Realm — The Pre-eminently Happy Realm, The Thickly-Formed Realm, The Realm of Long Hair, or the Illimitable Vihāra of the Lotus Radiance in Urgyan’s presence — direct your wish there with undistracted mind. By doing so, birth in that Realm occurs instantaneously.

If you desire to be with Maitreya in the Tushita Heavens, think with earnestness: “I will go to the presence of Maitreya in the Tushita Heavens, for the hour has struck for me here in the Intermediate State.” By that wish, you will be born miraculously inside a lotus blossom in Maitreya’s presence.
