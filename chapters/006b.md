### What It Means

This passage is tender because it meets the soul in confusion. Death has come, but it does not yet feel final. The spirit hovers, uncertain, still attached to familiar sights and sounds.

The teaching reassures: this too is an opportunity. Even if the Primary Light was missed, the Secondary Light offers another chance. It is softer, gentler, but still radiant.

The instruction to call the departed by name and remind them of their practice shows how personal this moment is. Liberation is not abstract; it is relational. The voice of a trusted friend, the memory of a beloved image, the echo of prayers repeated in life — these are anchors for the wandering mind.
