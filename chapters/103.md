## The Path of Good Wishes which Protects from Fear in the Bardo

1.

When the thread of my life is cut,
and no relative or friend can help,
when I wander alone through the Bardo—
O Conquerors, Peaceful and Wrathful,
through your boundless compassion,
dispel the darkness of ignorance.

2.

When I wander alone, parted from those I love,
and my own empty thought-forms rise before me,
may the Buddhas, with their great compassion,
remove fear and terror from the Bardo.

3.

When the radiant lights of the Five Wisdoms shine upon me,
may I not be terrified, but know them as my own true nature.
When the Peaceful and Wrathful forms appear before me,
may I recognize them, and find the fearless assurance of the Bardo.

4.

When I suffer from the weight of my own past actions,
may the Peaceful and Wrathful Conquerors lift that misery.
When the Sound of Reality roars like a thousand thunders,
may I hear it as the melody of the Great Teaching.

5.

When there is no protector, and karma must unfold,
I call upon the Peaceful and Wrathful Conquerors—protect me.
When karmic habits bring suffering,
may the blissful Clear Light of Samādhi shine upon me.

6.

When I take on a supernormal birth in the Bardo,
may the deceits of Māra not arise.
Wherever I arrive, wherever I go,
may I not be shaken by fear or illusion.

7.

When the roar of beasts terrifies me,
may their cries transform into the holy sound of the Six Syllables.
When snow, rain, wind, and storm press upon me,
may I see with the clear eyes of Wisdom.

8.

May all beings wandering with me in the Bardo,
without jealousy or rivalry, find birth in higher realms.
When hunger and thirst torment me,
may I be free from their sting, free from the pains of heat and cold.

9.

When I behold my future parents in union,
may I see them as the Divine Father and Mother,
the Peaceful and Wrathful Conquerors.
May I gain the power to choose birth for the good of others,
and obtain a perfect body, radiant with signs of blessing.

10.

May I obtain a strong body for service,
so that all who see or hear me may be liberated.
May the weight of evil karma not follow me,
but all merit increase and multiply.

11.

Wherever I am born, may I meet the Peaceful and Wrathful Deities.
May I walk and speak at birth,
with a mind that remembers past lives
and does not fall into forgetfulness.

12.

In all arts and sciences, great and small,
may I master them simply by hearing or seeing.
Wherever I am born, may it be auspicious.
May all beings everywhere be blessed with happiness.

13.

May I, and all beings,
become like the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones themselves—
equal in body, in followers, in lifespan, in realm,
and in the goodness of their holy names.

14.

Through the blessing of the countless Peaceful and Wrathful Ones,
through the gift-waves of Pure Reality,
through the power of devotion of all mystic practitioners,
may all wishes be fulfilled, here and now.

*Thus ends The Path of Good Wishes which Protects from Fear in the Bardo.*
