### Reflection

Close your eyes. Imagine that you awaken from a dream and are not sure if you are alive or not. You see familiar faces, you hear sounds, but something feels different — lighter, less solid. In that moment, remember:

*My mind is radiant Light.*

*Even if I am confused, I will not forget.*

*May my practice, my prayers, and my love*

*carry me into freedom.*
