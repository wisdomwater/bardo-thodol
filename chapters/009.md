# Chapter 9: Sounds, Lights, and Rays

Beloved one, whatever fear or awe may come to you now in the Bardo, remember these words:

*When strange visions dawn,*

*May I see them as my own mind’s reflections.*

*When radiant beings appear,*

*May I know them as my thought-forms.*

*When great sounds roll like thunder,*

*May I recognize them as my very self.*

*When Light blazes forth,*

*May I not be afraid. May I rest in its embrace.*

When your body and mind separated, you glimpsed a radiance — dazzling, sparkling, like a spring mirage shimmering across a field. Do not be afraid of this brilliance. It is the radiance of your own true nature.

From the midst of that light comes a great sound, reverberating like thousands of thunders at once. Do not be awed or daunted — this, too, is your own true voice, the sound of Reality itself.

Remember: the body you have now is a body of thought. You cannot be harmed. Sounds, lights, and rays cannot wound you. They are your own forms. Recognize this: this is the Bardo.

If you do not recognize, then fear may overwhelm you. The lights may daunt, the sounds may terrify, and you will wander again in the circles of becoming. But if you remember, you are free.

### What It Means

This passage reveals the great key of the Bardo: *recognition.*

The visions of light and sound are not external forces. They are the play of your own mind — dazzling, radiant, sometimes terrifying, but not other than you. This is why the teaching insists: do not fear. Fear arises only when we forget that what we see and hear is our own reflection.

This teaching also shows us how the after-death journey mirrors life. How often do we, in life, become afraid of our own thoughts, our own emotions, our own creations? How often do we believe them to be “other,” when they are born within? The practice of remembering this truth now is a preparation for remembering it then.

The sounds, lights, and rays are not enemies. They are invitations — mirrors pointing us back to the radiance of our own being.

Close your eyes and imagine dazzling lights flashing, colors vivid, sounds booming like thunder. Instead of recoiling, breathe and whisper:

*These are my own reflections.
This is my own light.
Nothing here can harm me.
In recognition, I am free.*
