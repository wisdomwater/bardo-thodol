## The Root Verses of the Six Bardos

**1. The Bardo of Birth**

O now, as the Bardo of Birth dawns before me:

May I abandon idleness—this human life leaves no room to waste.

May I enter into truth without distraction—listening, reflecting, meditating.

May I recognize the nature of appearances and of mind,

and awaken to the Three Bodies of Buddha.

Since I have attained this rare human form,

may I not let it slip away in idleness.

**2. The Bardo of Dreams**

O now, as the Bardo of Dreams dawns before me:

May I abandon the corpse-like sleep of ignorance.

May I keep awareness resting in its natural state.

May I recognize the dream as dream,

and train in the Clear Light of Illusory Transformation.

Not sinking in sloth like an animal,

may I blend the practice of dream and waking life,

holding them both as precious.

**3. The Bardo of Meditation**

O now, as the Bardo of Meditation dawns before me:

May I abandon distraction and illusion.

May I rest in endless, undistracted samādhi.

May I gain steadiness in both visualization and completion.

At this time of one-pointed practice, with all else set aside,

may I not fall under the sway of passions that confuse and dull the mind.

**4. The Bardo of Death**

O now, as the Bardo of Death dawns before me:

May I abandon craving and clinging to worldly things.

May I remain undistracted in the vast space of luminous teaching.

May I dissolve into the unborn sky of freedom.

The hour has come to part from this body of flesh and blood—

may I know it as impermanent, as an illusion, and let it go.

**5. The Bardo of Reality**

O now, as the Bardo of Reality dawns before me:

May I abandon fear, awe, and terror of appearances.

May I recognize them all as my own mind’s creations.

May I know them as illusions of the Intermediate State.

For it is said: “There comes a time when the turning point is reached—

fear not the hosts of Peaceful and Wrathful forms; they are your own thought-forms.”

**6. The Bardo of Rebirth**

O now, as the Bardo of Rebirth dawns before me:

May I hold one-pointedly to a single pure intention.

May I carry on the stream of good deeds without wavering.

May I close the womb-door and remember to turn away.

The hour has come when pure love and steadfast energy are needed.

May I cast off jealousy and rest in meditation on the Guru, the Father-Mother.

**7. The Call of Urgency**

O procrastinating one, blind to the certainty of death,

spending yourself in the useless busyness of this life,

you squander your great opportunity.

Mistaken indeed will you be, if you return empty-handed.

Since the holy Dharma is your true need,

will you not devote yourself to it—*even now*?

**Epilogue**

So speak the Great Adepts with devotion.

If the guru’s chosen teaching is not held in heart and mind,

will you not betray yourself?

It is of utmost importance that these Root Words be known.
