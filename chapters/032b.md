### What It Means

This passage describes the transition when the pull of rebirth begins to stir. The dying person sees the lights of the Six Realms — the habitual destinations of consciousness shaped by karma: divine, titanic, human, animal, hungry ghost, or hellish states.

The dullness of these lights contrasts with the brilliance of the earlier wisdom lights. They reflect the pull of old habits and attachments. What we loved, feared, or clung to in life now draws us like gravity.

The teaching offers an “art” — a profound shift of perception: to see every light, even those of lower realms, as emanations of compassion. Instead of being lured or repelled, one recognizes them as part of the divine play, as one’s own mind. This recognition breaks the chain of karma and opens the gate to liberation.

It is also a teaching about practice: form and formlessness. To meditate on a deity and then dissolve that image into clear light is to train in letting go of all appearances. It is practice in dying itself — resting in the luminous void where rebirth is no longer necessary.
