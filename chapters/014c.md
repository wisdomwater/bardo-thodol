### Reflection

Take a breath and recall a moment when jealousy clouded your joy — when you could not rejoice in another’s success, but felt comparison rise in your chest. Now picture before you a dazzling green light, radiant and clear, alongside a murky green glow whispering rivalry. Whisper softly:

*When jealousy rises, may I not be pulled away.*

*When rivalry tempts, may I let it pass.*

*May I rest in the dazzling green radiance of wisdom,*

*And act with clarity, compassion, and peace.*
