# The Colophon

Through the pure intention with which this was made,

and through the merit it carries,

may all beings without protection—our Mothers through countless lives—

find refuge in the state of Buddhahood.


May the radiant light of auspiciousness

shine forth to bless the world.

May this Book itself be a source of blessing.

May virtue and goodness reach their fullness in every way.
