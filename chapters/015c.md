### Reflection

Close your eyes and imagine yourself surrounded by a vast circle of light-beings — peaceful and fierce, gentle and powerful. Let them dazzle you, but do not shrink away. Instead, place your hand on your heart. Whisper gently:

*All these forms arise within me.*

*None come from outside.*

*Peaceful and wrathful, fierce and gentle,*

*all are radiance of my own heart.*

*May I recognize them as such,*

*and rest in the union of all wisdoms.*
