### What It Means

This passage offers the direct path to liberation through supernormal birth. Even if karmic obscurations remain, heartfelt aspiration can leap beyond samsara. The “Pure Lands” described here are not myths or external heavens but luminous states of mind where practice and awakening unfold effortlessly.

The text instructs: name your destination, choose it with clarity, and place your whole being in that vow. This is the art of conscious rebirth. The lotus blossom is a metaphor for rebirth without defilement — awakening directly into a field of compassion and wisdom.

This section also reveals something comforting: even if you have not achieved complete realization, your *heartfelt longing* — disgust for samsara combined with trust in the Buddhas — can carry you into a realm of safety and practice.
