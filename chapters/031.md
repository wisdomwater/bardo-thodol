## The All-Determining Influence of Thought

O nobly-born, know this: in the Bardo your thoughts carry immense weight. A single impulse of anger or clinging can pull you into the lower realms, while a single impulse of trust and devotion can lift you to liberation.

You will feel momentary joys and sorrows, as sharp and sudden as a catapult. Do not cling to the joys, nor resist the sorrows.

You may see your relatives performing rituals, sacrifices, or prayers on your behalf. Their actions may appear imperfect to your perception, and anger may arise: *“They are failing me, they are careless.”* Resist this thought, for it can drag you into hellish states. Instead, think: *“My own mind is clouded. I take refuge in the Three Jewels and entrust all to them.”*

You may feel attachment to the possessions you left behind, or resentment seeing them enjoyed by others. Let go of that. You cannot possess them now. Instead, dedicate them inwardly to the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. In release, there is freedom.

Know that even if the rituals for you are performed with flaws, your love and trust can transform them into true offerings. But resentment will poison them and bind you to suffering. Therefore, cultivate pure affection, humble faith, and impartial love.

Above all, remember: in this state your mind is weightless and quick. Whatever thought arises now has great power to shape your rebirth. Let devotion, not anger, be your guide.

### What It Means

This passage is one of the most practical of all the Bardo teachings. It reminds us that thought is destiny in the in-between. The mind, ungrounded by a physical body, is carried like a feather on the winds of karma. Every impulse of anger, clinging, or distrust shapes where we will land.

Even in life, we know this truth: our thoughts change our experience of the world. But here, thought is not just experience — it is creation. To be angry at one’s family, jealous of possessions, or scornful of imperfect rituals is to bind oneself to lower states. To cultivate trust, love, and surrender, even in confusion, is to open the way to freedom.

It is a teaching of immense compassion: you don’t need to be perfect, learned, or saintly. If you can remember devotion, affection, and prayer at this moment, it can carry you across.

*Breathing in, I release resentment.
Breathing out, I rest in trust.
Breathing in, I let go of clinging.
Breathing out, I dedicate all I have to the Three Jewels.*

*O Compassionate One,
when anger rises, soften me with love.
When jealousy arises, loosen me with trust.
When despair arises, lift me with light.
May every thought become a step toward freedom.*
