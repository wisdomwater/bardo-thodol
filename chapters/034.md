## The First Method of Closing the Womb-Door

O nobly-born, if you are drawn toward a womb, remember this teaching.

Whoever your tutelary deity may be, visualize them calmly — like the reflection of the moon upon water: shining, present, yet without true substance. If you have no tutelary deity, then meditate upon the Compassionate Lord, or even upon the one reading these words to you.

Let the form of the deity dissolve gradually from the edges inward, until only the clear, formless Light remains. Rest in that Light without forming thoughts. This profound practice alone can prevent you from entering a womb.

If, despite this, you feel yourself being drawn into a womb, then listen to the teaching of the First Method of Closing the Womb-Door:

When the Sidpa Bardo is dawning upon me,
May I hold one pure resolve in mind.
May I join the chain of good karma,
Close the womb-door, and remember the way of opposition.
At this time, earnestness and pure love are required;
Let me abandon jealousy and meditate upon the Guru as Father-Mother.

Repeat these words aloud if you can, and keep their meaning vividly in your heart.

Know this: in the Sidpa Bardo, you no longer cast a shadow, nor see your reflection in water or in mirrors. This is the sign that you no longer carry the gross body of flesh and blood. You now wander in the subtle body of desire.

At this time, form a single, unwavering resolve. It is like guiding a horse with reins — wherever your resolve points, your destiny follows. Do not let the mind dwell on harmful actions; hold only to the chain of good. Remember the bond with your guru, or with any who gave you teachings in the human life. Hold fast to that connection, for it can carry you upward.

The dividing line between liberation and bondage, between ascent and descent, is before you now. Even one moment of hesitation may cast you into long misery. Therefore, remain steadfast. Persist in the good. This is the moment of closing the womb-door.

### What It Means

Here, the teaching emphasizes that rebirth begins with desire and distraction. The way to prevent it is through *clarity* and *resolve*. To see your deity dissolve into pure Light is to remember that all forms, even the body you long for, are illusion.

The “womb-door” is both literal and symbolic. Literally, it is the pull toward a new physical body. Symbolically, it is the pull of desire into any binding form — be it anger, jealousy, or attachment. Closing the womb-door means refusing to be caught by illusion and resting instead in the Clear Light.

The instruction to hold “one single resolve” is profound: in this subtle state, the mind is highly powerful and creative. Even a flicker of anger or longing can determine your rebirth. But so too can a flicker of devotion, love, and remembrance of the Guru or the Compassionate One lead you upward or even free you entirely.

### Reflection

Turn inward for a moment and notice the stillness waiting there. Whisper:

*Breathing in, I remember my true refuge.*

*Breathing out, I dissolve all forms into Light.*

*Breathing in, I steady my heart with one pure resolve.*

*Breathing out, I close the doors of illusion.*

*O Compassionate One, when the womb-doors open before me,*

*let me not be drawn by desire.*

*Let me not mistake illusion for refuge.*

*Strengthen me to hold a single, pure resolve.*

*May I remain in the Clear Light,*

*or rise into the realms of freedom,*

*and not fall again into the nets of bondage.*
