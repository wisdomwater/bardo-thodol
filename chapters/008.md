# Chapter 8: Entering the Bardo of Reality

Beloved one, you have been given the Light once — perhaps twice — and still you wander. Now a new stage dawns: the Bardo of the Experiencing of Reality. Here the world of appearances rises like a theatre of sound and light. Karmic visions will shine — sometimes gentle, sometimes terrifying — and the mind may be bewildered.

Listen closely. There are six kinds of bardos in the whole weave of life and death: the bardo of the womb, the bardo of dreams, the bardo of deep meditative equipoise, the bardo of the moment of death, the bardo of experiencing reality (this one), and the bardo that leads toward rebirth. You have just passed the moment of death; now you enter the Chönyid Bardo and, after that, the Sidpa Bardo.

Do not be surprised by what you see. You will notice household sounds — food being prepared, clothes taken away, the sorrow of friends. You will hear your name and yet feel unseen. Do not cling in confusion. Do not be drawn back by grief or attachment; such pulling will only lead to wandering in samsāra. Hear these words as if they were spoken into the ear of your own heart: this is not the place to grasp. Hold steady. Attend.

If you are near, call the beloved by name and speak with loving clarity: explain that this is the Chönyid Bardo, and urge the mind to listen and remain undistracted. Remind them gently to remember the Precious Three — the teachers, the truth, the path — and to refrain from clinging to the scenes that arise.

### What It Means

This section prepares us for the most confusing part of the journey. After the clear dawn of the Light, the mind often drifts into a cascade of images and sensations — the very contents of one’s life and the echoes of habit. These karmic apparitions can dazzle or terrify. They are not ultimately real; they are appearances shaped by habit, fear, and desire.

Naming the six bardos is a compassionate map. It reassures the traveler that the current experience is one stage among many — not the final verdict. The repeated instruction to *not cling* is practical and gentle: attachment is the force that tethers consciousness back into cycles of becoming. The antidote is attention — steady, loving, and undistracted.

Notice how the text instructs loved ones to call the departed by name. This is not superstition; it is relational aid. A familiar voice, a remembered practice, a clear instruction — these anchor the mind and give it a foothold away from panic and toward recognition.

### Reflection


Sit for a moment and breathe slowly. Imagine sounds and images washing around you like waves. Practice being the witness of those waves without diving into any one of them. Whisper or breathe this little prayer:


*This is a passage, not a prison.*

*May I not cling to shadows.*

*May loving speech and steady attention guide me into the Light.*

*When illusions rise, may I remember my true home.*
