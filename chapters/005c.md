### Reflection

Sit quietly and place your hand over your heart. Imagine your last breath leaving, and in its place a vast radiance opening. In that radiance, let compassion arise. Whisper within:

*May this life, and even my death, serve all beings.*

*May I awaken, not for myself alone, but for love without measure.*

*My mind and the Light are one.*

*In this union, there is no fear, only freedom.*
