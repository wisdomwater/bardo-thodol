### Reflection

Close your eyes. Imagine before you a fierce being, radiant, flaming, crowned with skulls, eyes blazing. Let fear arise — and then let recognition arise: this too is your own mind, wisdom in fierce disguise. Whisper softly:

*Peaceful or wrathful, gentle or fierce,*

*all are the play of my own true mind.*

*I will not fear. I will not turn away.*

*In recognition, I am free.*
