### What It Means

The dawning of Heruka marks the first of the Wrathful Deities cycle. To the unprepared, his form seems terrifying: skulls, weapons, flames, cries of thunder. Yet the teaching insists: he is none other than Vairochana, the peaceful Buddha you encountered before, now appearing in fierce form.

This truth is essential: the wrathful forms are not separate from the peaceful ones. They are two faces of the same wisdom. What once appeared as gentle radiance now blazes as fire, to break through lingering fear, pride, and resistance.

In life, too, wisdom sometimes comes gently, sometimes fiercely. Compassion may comfort, or it may roar, shaking us from delusion. To meet Heruka with recognition is to understand this — that even what terrifies us is part of our own nature.
