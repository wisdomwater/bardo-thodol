### What It Means

This day is both the most overwhelming and the most revealing. All the deities — peaceful and wrathful, serene and fierce — appear together. It is the great unveiling: the recognition that every divine form, every sound, every light, is a manifestation of your own innermost nature.

The teaching insists: nothing comes from outside. The vast assembly of Buddhas and guardians is not foreign. They are your own mind’s radiant display. To recognize this is to know that all appearances — bright or terrifying — are inseparable from your true self.

The fierce forms remind us of the energies we often repress or fear in life. In the Bardo, they return, not to harm, but to awaken. They are the same radiance as the peaceful Buddhas, wearing masks of intensity to break through resistance.

The instruction here is simple and profound: *Do not be afraid. Recognize all these forms as your own mind. Rest in the union of all wisdoms, and you will be free.*
