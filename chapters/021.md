# Chapter 21: The Tenth Day — Ratna-Heruka Appears

O beloved one, listen carefully. On this day, the blood-drinking deities of the Ratna, or Jewel, Order will arise.

From the southern quarter of your mind emerges Ratna-Heruka, yellow in color, with three faces, six hands, and four feet standing firmly upon the ground. His right face is white, his left red, and his central face a dark golden yellow. Flames blaze all around him.

In his right hands he holds a gem, a trident-staff, and a baton; in his left hands, a bell, a skull-bowl, and another trident-staff. He is embraced by the Mother, Ratna-Krotiśaurima, who clasps his neck with one arm and offers him a red shell filled with blood with the other.

They appear fierce, radiant, and awe-inspiring, shining before you. But know this: they are not external beings. They are the radiance of your own intellect, appearing in wrathful form. In truth, they are none other than Ratna-Sambhava, Father and Mother, the Jewel Buddha.

Do not be terrified. Do not turn away. Recognize them as your own inner wisdom, and in that moment recognition and liberation become one.

### What It Means

The Ratna, or Jewel, family represents equanimity and abundance. Ratna-Sambhava is the giver of richness, the one who transforms pride and greed into the spacious wisdom of equality.

Here he appears as Ratna-Heruka, fierce and blazing, yet still your own essence. The yellow light and jewel he holds symbolize both wealth and the deep truth that all beings share the same worth. The skull-bowl and tridents remind you that clinging to possessions, status, or identity is empty — these, too, are dissolved in wisdom.

The challenge of this day is to see abundance not as something to grasp at, but as your own innate nature. To recognize that the terror of loss and the greed for gain are illusions. When you know this, the wrathful transforms into the liberating, and you rest in the wisdom of equality.

Place your hand over your heart. Imagine a great being of golden-yellow light, fierce and radiant, offering you both fire and treasure. Breathe gently and whisper:

*This is my mind in its jewel form.
This is abundance without clinging.
I will not fear. I will recognize.
In recognition, I am free.*
