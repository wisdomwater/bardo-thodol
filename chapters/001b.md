### What It Means

The text begins with bowing — not as empty ritual, but as orientation. Before the vast mystery of death, we acknowledge what is greater than us: the Light beyond comprehension, the guides who embody compassion in countless forms, and the teachers who preserved this wisdom.

The promise is simple yet profound: *hearing truth can set one free.* Even at death, when all else falls away, remembering — even dimly — can bring release.

This opening also reassures us: liberation is not only for the saints or scholars. It is for the ordinary. For you. For me. The journey through the bardo is not a test to pass, but an invitation to listen, trust, and remember.
