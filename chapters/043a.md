# Chapter 43: The Alternative Choosing: Supernormal Birth or Womb-Birth

O nobly-born, if karma compels you to enter a womb, hear this teaching. Do not enter blindly into the first doorway that appears. If tormenting furies press you, call upon Hayagriva for strength.

At this time you possess a subtle power of foreknowledge. One by one, the places of possible birth will appear to you. Choose with care.

Two paths are open:

1. The transference of consciousness into a pure Buddha realm.
2. The selection of a womb-door within the cycle of samsara.

Choose wisely.
