### What It Means

Here the text adds something profound: dying is not only an opportunity for personal liberation, but for *the flowering of compassion*. The instruction is to meet death not with fear or grasping, but with a vow to awaken for the sake of others.

This shifts the whole meaning of death. It is not merely about one’s own fate, but about love without limits. The dying soul is reminded: *You are not a flickering candle being snuffed out, but the very light itself, inseparable from the source of all goodness.*

Even if recognition is partial, even if the Clear Light is not fully realized, this compassionate resolve plants the deepest seed. It is the heart’s offering, strong enough to shape the journey ahead.
