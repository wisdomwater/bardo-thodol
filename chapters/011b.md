### What It Means

This stage reveals the pull of anger. The teaching shows how destructive habits appear not only in life, but after death. Anger clouds the vision and makes the soul recoil from the brilliance of truth. Out of fear, we may choose what feels easier — the smoky, familiar light — even if it leads to suffering.

The instruction is clear: resist the pull of anger. Do not shrink from brilliance. The white light of Vajrasattva is Mirror-like Wisdom — the truth that all things reflect without distortion when seen clearly. To rest in that wisdom is to see reality as it is, beyond judgment or reaction.

The image of Vajrasattva with his companions is meant to steady the mind. Surrounded by these compassionate presences, the soul is not alone. Their light is not to be feared, but embraced.
