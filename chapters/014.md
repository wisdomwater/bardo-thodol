# Chapter 14: The Fifth Day — The Green Light of Amogha-Siddhi

Beloved one, even when liberation is close, old habits of jealousy and rivalry can obscure your vision. If these bind you still, then on the Fifth Day another light will dawn.

From the Northern Realm of Accomplished Deeds appears Amogha-Siddhi, the Buddha of all-pervading action. His body glows green, he bears the crossed dorje of unshakable power, and he sits upon a sky-borne throne of Garuḍa wings. At his side is the Divine Mother, the faithful Tārā, radiant with compassion. With them shine the bodhisattvas Chag-na-Dorje and Dibpanamsel, and the female companions Gandhema and Nidhema. Together, six beings appear in a rainbow halo of light.

From their heart streams the green light of All-Performing Wisdom — dazzling, radiant, transparent, striking your heart with a brilliance almost too great to endure. This is your own wisdom, shining as the power to act with clarity and compassion. Do not fear it. Rest in it with impartiality.

Alongside it glimmers another light: a dull, murky green glow, the path of the jealous asura realm. Born of rivalry and comparison, it tempts the heart with conflict. Do not be deceived. If you follow it, you will fall into the world of constant strife, where beings are trapped in endless battles, forever unsatisfied.

Therefore, listen well: do not recoil from the brilliant green radiance. Trust it, even if it feels overwhelming. Place your whole mind on Amogha-Siddhi and Tārā, and pray:

*Alas! When wandering in samsāra through jealousy and rivalry,*

*On the radiant path of All-Performing Wisdom,*

*May I be led by Amogha-Siddhi.*

*May the Divine Mother Tārā guard my back.*

*May I cross safely through the ambush of the Bardo,*

*And awaken in the perfect Buddhahood of the Northern Realm.*

If you pray with humility and deep trust, you will merge into the rainbow halo of Amogha-Siddhi and attain awakening.

### What It Means

The Fifth Day reveals how jealousy blinds the soul. The green radiance is the wisdom of enlightened action — the clarity that knows what to do, and how to serve, without hesitation. But jealousy twists action into rivalry: we compare, compete, and struggle for status.

In the Bardo, this distortion appears as attraction to the asura light: the realm of conflict, where beings live in constant combat, never satisfied, always striving. The teaching warns that if you follow that path, you inherit endless struggle.

The remedy is *impartiality*. The text instructs the soul to rest in a state of evenness, not pushed by fear nor pulled by attraction. This balance allows the wisdom of action to shine, transforming impulse into compassionate power.

Take a breath and recall a moment when jealousy clouded your joy — when you could not rejoice in another’s success, but felt comparison rise in your chest. Now picture before you a dazzling green light, radiant and clear, alongside a murky green glow whispering rivalry. Whisper softly:

*When jealousy rises, may I not be pulled away.
When rivalry tempts, may I let it pass.
May I rest in the dazzling green radiance of wisdom,
And act with clarity, compassion, and peace.*
