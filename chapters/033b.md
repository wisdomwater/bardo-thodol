### What It Means

This passage describes the beginning of *rebirth-seeking*. As karma ripens, consciousness is drawn toward new parents, pulled by attraction and aversion. This attraction is the seed of embodiment: desire pulls us into matter.

The “closing of the womb-door” means learning to recognize this pull as illusion. Instead of following attraction into birth, one turns the mind back to its source — the Clear Light, or the Compassionate One. It is a reminder that even at the threshold of rebirth, liberation is still possible.

The imagery of storms, pursuit, and flashes of birthplace is psychological: it is the mind being driven by fear, desire, and habit. To remember — “this is illusion, this is my own mind” — is to remain free.

The two methods reflect this:

* Preventing entry: not allowing yourself to be carried by attraction into a womb.
* Closing the womb itself: recognizing its unreality and preventing it from appearing as a viable refuge.

In essence, the practice is restraint of desire, recognition of illusion, and remembrance of the Divine.
