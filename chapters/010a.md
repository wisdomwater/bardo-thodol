# Chapter 10: The First Day — The Blue Light of Vairochana

Beloved one, you have lain in a swoon for three and a half days. Now you awaken and wonder: *“What has happened to me?”* Know this — you are in the Bardo. Do not be distracted.

The heavens now turn a deep and radiant blue. From the central realm, the seed of all manifestation, appears Vairochana — white in color, seated on a lion throne, holding the eight-spoked wheel of truth, embraced by the Mother of Infinite Space.

From the heart of this Father-Mother union shines the brilliant **blue light of Dharma-Dhātu Wisdom**. It is dazzling, clear, radiant beyond measure, almost too intense to gaze upon. Alongside it appears another light: a dull white glow, the light of the gods of desire, soft and enticing.

Because of habit and karma, you may feel afraid of the blazing blue light and drawn to the gentle dull glow. Do not be fooled. The blue light is the Light of Truth, the wisdom of Vairochana, who comes to meet you in this hour.

Therefore, hear these words: Do not fear the brilliant radiance. Do not shrink from it. Place your trust in it completely. Pray with your whole heart, saying:

*Alas! When wandering in samsāra, through my ignorance and forgetfulness,*

*May I be led by the radiant blue light of Dharma-Dhātu Wisdom.*

*May Vairochana shine before me, and the Mother of Infinite Space guard my back.*

*May I cross safely through the ambush of the Bardo.*

*May I awaken into the perfect Buddhahood of the Central Realm.*

If you hold this prayer with humble faith, you will merge into the radiant halo of Vairochana and attain freedom in the realm of perfect light.
