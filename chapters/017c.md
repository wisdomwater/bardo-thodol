### Reflection

Sit quietly. Imagine a great mandala of deities, five-colored lights streaming into your heart, thunder shaking the skies. At the edges, a dim blue glow beckons with false safety. Breathe and whisper:

*The fierce and the gentle, the lights and the sounds,*

*all are my own wisdom.*

*I will not fear them. I will not turn aside.*

*I choose the rainbow radiance,*

*and awaken into freedom.*
