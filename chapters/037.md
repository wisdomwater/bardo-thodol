## The Fourth Method of Closing the Womb-Door

O nobly-born, if the womb-door is still not closed, then meditate on *The Untrue and the Illusory.*

Think thus:

“O, the father and mother, the black rain, the storm-blasts, the frightening sounds, the visions of form — these are illusions. They have no real substance. They are dreams, phantoms, echoes, mirages, images in water. They are non-permanent and without fixity. Why should I cling to them? Why should I fear them?

These are but hallucinations of my own mind. And the illusory mind itself has no foundation from eternity. Where then could these appearances exist?

Because I did not know this truth, I mistook the unreal for the real and wandered so long in the Sangsāra. If I still fail to recognize them as illusions, I shall wander on endlessly in suffering. But now I see: all is illusion. They cannot bind me.”

By holding firmly to this realization, the belief in their reality will dissolve. Imprinting this deeply on consciousness, the womb-door will close.

This is the teaching of illusion — one of the deepest keys in Buddhist thought. Everything that appears, whether beautiful or terrifying, parental or monstrous, is mind’s projection. To take these projections as ultimately real is to be trapped in Sangsāra.

But when we recognize them as illusions — fleeting, dreamlike, without lasting substance — the spell is broken. The doorway of rebirth cannot hold us, because there is no real “door” to pass through.

The practice here is one of radical letting go: loosening the grip of belief in appearances, whether they inspire fear or desire. In that loosening, liberation becomes possible.

*Breathing in, I see all things as dreamlike.
Breathing out, I let go of my fear.
Breathing in, I see all things as illusion.
Breathing out, I let go of my grasping.*

*O Compassionate One,
teach me to see the unreal as unreal.
Let me not mistake shadow for substance,
nor fear for truth.
May I awaken from the dream of Sangsāra,
and rest in the Clear Light of freedom.*
