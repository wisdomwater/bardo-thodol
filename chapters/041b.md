### What It Means

At the threshold of rebirth, visions come that mirror the Six Realms of existence. These visions are not random — they reveal where karmic forces are leading. The teaching gives us discernment: which visions to resist, which to embrace.

The Southern Continent, where Dharma prevails, is considered the most fortunate human rebirth, for it is the ground of practice. Even devas (gods), though radiant, are often lulled into complacency; the human realm offers the chance to awaken through both joy and suffering.

The warning is clear: wealth, beauty, or ease without Dharma leads to wandering. Better to choose conditions that, though imperfect, turn the heart toward awakening. The heart of this teaching is intentionality at the very brink: even if karma pulls, awareness can still redirect.
