### Reflection

Close your eyes. Imagine standing at a doorway. Behind you is a familiar room — life, with all its joys and burdens. Before you lies a great horizon of light you cannot yet name. Whisper within:

*When the thresholds of life come, may I not fear.*

*When the signs of change appear, may I remember the Light.*

*Liberation is not far, not reserved for the wise.*

*It is here, as close as my own hearing.*
