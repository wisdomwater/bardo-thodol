# Chapter 21: The Tenth Day — Ratna-Heruka Appears

O beloved one, listen carefully. On this day, the blood-drinking deities of the Ratna, or Jewel, Order will arise.

From the southern quarter of your mind emerges Ratna-Heruka, yellow in color, with three faces, six hands, and four feet standing firmly upon the ground. His right face is white, his left red, and his central face a dark golden yellow. Flames blaze all around him.

In his right hands he holds a gem, a trident-staff, and a baton; in his left hands, a bell, a skull-bowl, and another trident-staff. He is embraced by the Mother, Ratna-Krotiśaurima, who clasps his neck with one arm and offers him a red shell filled with blood with the other.

They appear fierce, radiant, and awe-inspiring, shining before you. But know this: they are not external beings. They are the radiance of your own intellect, appearing in wrathful form. In truth, they are none other than Ratna-Sambhava, Father and Mother, the Jewel Buddha.

Do not be terrified. Do not turn away. Recognize them as your own inner wisdom, and in that moment recognition and liberation become one.
