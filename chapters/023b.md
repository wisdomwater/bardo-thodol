### What It Means

The Karma family is linked with action, accomplishment, and skillful means. Amogha-Siddhi represents the wisdom that brings forth enlightened activity in the world. When this energy appears in its wrathful form, it may seem terrifying, like overwhelming force or unstoppable momentum.

But the truth is that this power is your own — the dynamic energy of your life-force, capable of creating or destroying, healing or harming. When seen clearly, it is the wisdom that accomplishes what is needed for liberation. When misunderstood, it can fuel fear, jealousy, and destructive action.

This chapter reminds us that liberation comes not by running away, but by recognizing even the most frightening energies as our own mind. When we see that nothing is foreign, fear dissolves.
