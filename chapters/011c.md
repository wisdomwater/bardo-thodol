### Reflection

Take a breath and remember a time when anger made you recoil from truth, preferring something easier but less true. Whisper within:

*When anger clouds my vision, may I not turn away.*

*When smoky shadows tempt me, may I not be deceived.*

*May I rest in the radiant white light of wisdom,*

*And awaken into clarity and peace.*
