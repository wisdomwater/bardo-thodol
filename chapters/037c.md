### Reflection

Breathe into your belly and feel the rise and fall of your own belonging. Say:

*Breathing in, I see all things as dreamlike.*

*Breathing out, I let go of my fear.*

*Breathing in, I see all things as illusion.*

*Breathing out, I let go of my grasping.*

*O Compassionate One,*

*teach me to see the unreal as unreal.*

*Let me not mistake shadow for substance,*

*nor fear for truth.*

*May I awaken from the dream of Sangsāra,*

*and rest in the Clear Light of freedom.*
