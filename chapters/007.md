# Chapter 7: The Gentle Reminder

Beloved one, if you cannot hold your mind on the subtle Light, then turn it now to compassion. Meditate upon the Great Compassionate One — the Lord of Mercy whose heart embraces all beings. Even a single moment of turning toward compassion can bring recognition of the truth.

Know this: many who once heard these teachings may not be able to remember them now. Some are confused by illness, some are shaken by fear, some are burdened by broken vows or neglected duties. To all such ones, this gentle reminder is essential.

Even if you missed the first opportunity, this second dawning still offers freedom. At this stage your form is like an *illusory body of light* — shimmering, subtle, not yet bound. You may not know whether you are alive or dead, but your awareness is clear.

Hear this truth:
*When the Clear Light meets your awareness, like the meeting of mother and child, karma has no hold. Like sunlight dispelling darkness, the Light on the Path dissolves the chains of past actions.*

Therefore, listen well: do not wander, do not be distracted. Abide in the Light, and let yourself be carried into freedom.

### What It Means

This passage shows immense tenderness. It admits that most of us, in the chaos of death, will be forgetful. Fear, pain, or guilt may overwhelm even those who practiced in life. Yet the teaching insists: liberation is still possible.

The key is *remembrance*, often with the help of another’s voice. The instruction to meditate on compassion is not a fallback — it is the heart of the path. To turn to compassion, even when confused, is to align with the Light itself.

The imagery of the “illusory body” is powerful. After death, the soul is not bound as before; it is light-filled, hovering near what it loved. In this delicate state, a gentle reminder can make all the difference, opening the way before karmic visions take hold.

### Reflection

Close your eyes and imagine yourself unsure — not knowing if you are alive or gone. In that uncertainty, imagine a voice of kindness calling you back to compassion. Whisper softly:

*When confusion comes, may compassion guide me.
When fear grips me, may mercy free me.
Even in forgetfulness, may a gentle reminder
return me to the Light.*
