### Reflection

Close your eyes. Imagine brilliant lights of blue, white, yellow, and red shining together, dazzling in their radiance. Beside them, dimmer glows flicker, familiar but heavy. Whisper softly:

*These brilliant lights are my own nature.*

*These dim glows are only shadows of habit.*

*May I not be afraid, nor be deceived.*

*May I recognize the wisdom within me,*

*As a child recognizes its mother.*

*In that recognition, may I be free.*
