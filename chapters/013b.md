### What It Means

This day reveals the danger of attachment. In life, craving and clinging distort perception; in the Bardo, they take shape as an almost irresistible pull toward the hungry ghost light.

The red light of Amitābha is not a threat but a gift. It is the wisdom that discerns each thing clearly, without confusion. It shows the uniqueness of every being, not to grasp at it, but to honor it. Yet, to the mind still bound by craving, this clarity can feel too intense, almost painful.

The dull red glow seems comforting, but it is the trap of desire itself. It pulls the soul into the realm of Pretas, where thirst and hunger are never satisfied. The teaching is blunt: turn away from it. Do not settle for the glow of craving when the radiance of liberation is before you.
