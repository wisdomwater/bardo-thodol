### Reflection

Place your palm over your chest, feeling each breath as a gift. Murmur:

*Breathing in, I stand at the threshold.*

*Breathing out, I choose with wisdom.*

*Breathing in, I remember the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.*

*Breathing out, I trust their guidance.*

*O Compassionate Ones,*

*if I must take form again,*

*let it be where love may grow,*

*where the Dharma may be heard,*

*and where wisdom can awaken.*

*Even in rebirth,*

*may I be turned toward the Light.*
