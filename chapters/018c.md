### Reflection

Close your eyes. Picture a radiant Buddha you love, gentle and peaceful. Now imagine that same radiance blazing with fire, fangs, and fierce eyes. Both are the same essence, two masks of wisdom. Breathe and whisper:

*Peaceful or wrathful, gentle or fierce,*

*all are the radiance of my own heart.*

*May I not fear them,*

*but recognize them as friends,*

*and awaken into freedom.*
