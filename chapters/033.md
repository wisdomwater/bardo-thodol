## The Closing of the Door of the Womb

O nobly-born, if you do not understand the earlier teachings, the pull of karma will draw you onward. You may feel as though you are rising upward, moving level, or sinking downward. Fierce winds, icy blasts, hail, darkness, and the sense of being pursued will come upon you.

If your karma is heavy and unwholesome, you will feel driven toward places of misery. If your karma is virtuous, you will feel drawn toward places of happiness. At that moment, signs of the place of your next birth will appear before you.

Now listen carefully. Even if you failed to recognize the earlier teachings, here you may still awaken, for even those of weak devotion often recognize the signs of rebirth. Therefore, remember the Compassionate One, and meditate upon Him.

At this stage, the teaching of closing the womb-door is most vital. Two methods are taught:

1. Preventing yourself from entering the womb.
2. Closing the womb itself so it may not be entered.

Hold these teachings well, for they determine whether you are swept again into samsara or remain in the freedom of the Clear Light.

### What It Means

This passage describes the beginning of *rebirth-seeking*. As karma ripens, consciousness is drawn toward new parents, pulled by attraction and aversion. This attraction is the seed of embodiment: desire pulls us into matter.

The “closing of the womb-door” means learning to recognize this pull as illusion. Instead of following attraction into birth, one turns the mind back to its source — the Clear Light, or the Compassionate One. It is a reminder that even at the threshold of rebirth, liberation is still possible.

The imagery of storms, pursuit, and flashes of birthplace is psychological: it is the mind being driven by fear, desire, and habit. To remember — “this is illusion, this is my own mind” — is to remain free.

The two methods reflect this:

* Preventing entry: not allowing yourself to be carried by attraction into a womb.
* Closing the womb itself: recognizing its unreality and preventing it from appearing as a viable refuge.

In essence, the practice is restraint of desire, recognition of illusion, and remembrance of the Divine.

### Reflection

Rest your hands in your lap and feel the warmth of being alive. Say softly:

*Breathing in, I remember the Compassionate One.
Breathing out, I close the door to illusion.
Breathing in, storms and terrors arise.
Breathing out, I rest in the Clear Light.*

*O Compassionate One,
when winds drive me,
when womb-doors appear before me,
let me not be carried by desire.
Let me not mistake illusion for refuge.
Turn me back into Your embrace,
the unborn, unending radiance.
May I awaken here,
before the chains of birth close upon me again.*
