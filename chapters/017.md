# Chapter 17: The Seventh Day — The Circle of Knowledge-Holders

Beloved one, on the Seventh Day the Knowledge-Holding Deities descend from the holy realms to meet you. At the same time, the dim pathway to the brute world also appears, born of the passion of ignorance.

At the center shines the Lotus Lord of Dance, the Supreme Knowledge-Holder, radiant in five colors, embraced by the Red Ḍākinī. In his hands he holds a crescent blade and a skull-cup filled with blood, symbols of wisdom cutting through illusion and transforming the very essence of life into awakening. His dance, wild and radiant, is the mudrā of fascination — fierce yet liberating.

Around him appear four companions:

* To the east, the Earth-Abiding Knowledge-Holder, white, radiant, and smiling, embraced by the White Ḍākinī.
* To the south, the Life-Master Knowledge-Holder, golden yellow, radiant, embraced by the Yellow Ḍākinī.
* To the west, the Knowledge-Holder of the Great Symbol, red and joyful, embraced by the Red Ḍākinī.
* To the north, the Self-Evolved Knowledge-Holder, green, with a half-fierce, half-smiling face, embraced by the Green Ḍākinī.

Around this circle gather countless Ḍākinīs from cremation grounds, pilgrimage sites, and holy abodes. They dance wildly, adorned with bone ornaments, beating drums made of skulls, blowing trumpets of thigh-bone, waving banners of human skin, filling the worlds with thunderous sound. The air quakes with their music, both terrifying and awe-inspiring.

From the hearts of the five Knowledge-Holders stream five-colored radiances, dazzling like woven rainbow threads, too bright to behold. These lights are the purified propensities, the Wisdom of Simultaneous Birth. They strike your heart with their brilliance. At the same time, a dull blue light — the lure of the brute world — glows beside them.

Beloved one, fear not the brilliant rainbow radiance. It is your own wisdom, dazzling in its fullness. Do not be lured by the dim blue light of the animal realm, which leads to a life of dullness, instinct, and bondage. If you fall into it, escape will be long and painful.

Within the five-colored lights resounds the sound of Truth — rolling like a thousand thunders, echoing with mantras and fierce cries of “Slay! Slay!” Do not fear these sounds. They are the voices of your own intellect, the power of your own awakened mind.

Therefore, pray with all your heart:
*O Knowledge-Holders, hear me now!
When I wander in the storms of samsāra,
On the radiant light-path of Wisdom,
May your bands of Heroes lead me;
May your Mothers, the Ḍākinīs, guard my back;
May I be saved from the snares of the Bardo,
And led into the pure Paradise Realms.*

If you pray with humility and deep faith, you will merge into their rainbow hearts, and there will be no doubt of awakening.

### What It Means

The Seventh Day brings the most dramatic display yet — Knowledge-Holders, Ḍākinīs, and hosts of fierce protectors filling the sky with sound, dance, and radiance. It is overwhelming by design: the soul is shaken free of its old habits and compelled to recognize truth.

The teaching insists again: all of this arises from within. The lights, the sounds, the terrifying cries, the fierce dances — these are not enemies. They are the purified powers of your own heart and mind, dazzling you into remembrance.

The danger lies in preferring the dull blue light of ignorance, the lure of the brute realm. To choose this is to turn away from brilliance out of fear, settling for a life of dull instinct and bondage. The choice is clear: do not cling to the dim familiar. Step into the rainbow radiance.

---

Sit quietly. Imagine a great mandala of deities, five-colored lights streaming into your heart, thunder shaking the skies. At the edges, a dim blue glow beckons with false safety.

Breathe and whisper:
*The fierce and the gentle, the lights and the sounds,*

*all are my own wisdom.*
*I will not fear them. I will not turn aside.*

*I choose the rainbow radiance,*

*and awaken into freedom.*
