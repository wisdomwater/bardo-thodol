# Chapter 17: The Seventh Day — The Knowledge-Holding Deities

### The Text (retold)

Beloved one, if fear drives you toward the dim lights of the six realms, you will be pulled back into samsāra, circling endlessly through suffering. But even now, the radiances of wisdom shine to free you. Do not fear them. Do not cling to the familiar shadows. Trust that the lights of the Buddhas come from compassion alone, to guide you safely.

On the Seventh Day, new beings appear — the Knowledge-Holding Deities. They come from holy realms, radiant with power, and they shine together with the many-colored light of purified propensities.

At the center of the mandala appears the Supreme Knowledge-Holder, the Lotus Lord of Dance. His body gleams with all five colors. In his hands he holds a crescent blade and a skull-cup brimming with blood — symbols of wisdom cutting through ignorance and transforming life’s essence into awakening. He is embraced by the red Ḍākinī, radiant and fierce in compassion. Together they dazzle you in rainbow light, dancing with a mudrā of enchantment, their energy fierce but liberating.

At the same time, another glow appears — a dull pathway opening toward the animal realm, born of ignorance and dullness of mind. It lures with its heaviness, pulling toward a life of instinct and unknowing.

Beloved one, do not be afraid of the dazzling radiance of the Knowledge-Holders. Do not be drawn to the dim light of ignorance. If you can rest in the colorful brilliance, trusting in its truth, you will be led safely through the Bardo.

The Seventh Day is the final movement of the Peaceful Deities cycle. Here the emphasis shifts: instead of the Five Buddhas appearing in sequence, a new group — the Knowledge-Holding Deities — steps forward. They represent the wisdom that *remembers* and *ripens karma*. Their fierce forms remind us that wisdom is not always gentle: sometimes it cuts, shocks, and transforms.

The Lotus Lord of Dance is a vivid symbol. His dance is the play of energy itself, the dynamic rhythm of life and death. The skull-cup brimming with blood shows us that even what seems frightening — mortality, impermanence, suffering — can be transmuted into wisdom. The Ḍākinī consort embodies raw, vibrant compassion, which does not shrink from truth but embraces it fully.

The danger on this day is ignorance. The animal path symbolizes living without awareness, being ruled by instinct and habit. It may feel safe or easy, but it is a trap of dullness. The teaching is clear: *do not follow it*.

Take a breath. Imagine before you a radiant figure dancing in light, fierce yet compassionate, holding both blade and vessel. Around him shines rainbow brilliance. Beside it glows a dim, heavy light pulling you toward unknowing.

Whisper:
*When dullness tempts me, may I not fall asleep.*

*When fear arises, may I not turn away.*

*May I dance with wisdom’s fierce light,*

*And awaken in the radiance of truth.*
