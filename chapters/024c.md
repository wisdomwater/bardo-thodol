### Reflection

Close your eyes and breathe. Imagine all the terrifying figures of your own fears, instincts, and shadows arising. Whisper:

*Fierce dakinis of my mind,*

*I recognize you.*

*You are not enemies,*

*but my own strength in disguise.*

*I will not fear you.*

*I welcome you back into the light.*
