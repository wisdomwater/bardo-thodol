### What It Means

This passage reveals the great key of the Bardo: *recognition.*

The visions of light and sound are not external forces. They are the play of your own mind — dazzling, radiant, sometimes terrifying, but not other than you. This is why the teaching insists: do not fear. Fear arises only when we forget that what we see and hear is our own reflection.

This teaching also shows us how the after-death journey mirrors life. How often do we, in life, become afraid of our own thoughts, our own emotions, our own creations? How often do we believe them to be “other,” when they are born within? The practice of remembering this truth now is a preparation for remembering it then.

The sounds, lights, and rays are not enemies. They are invitations — mirrors pointing us back to the radiance of our own being.
