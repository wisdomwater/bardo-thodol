# Chapter 11: The Second Day — The White Light of Vajrasattva

Beloved one, if you could not recognize the blue light of Vairochana, another chance now arises. On the Second Day, a new radiance dawns.

From the deep-blue Eastern Realm of Supreme Happiness appears Vajrasattva — also known as Akṣobhya — blue in color, seated upon an elephant throne, holding the five-pronged dorje of unshakable truth, embraced by the Mother Māmakī. With them are four attendants: the bodhisattvas Kṣitigarbha and Maitreya, and the female bodhisattvas Lasema and Puṣhpema. Six radiant beings surround you with compassion.

From their heart shines the brilliant white light of Mirror-like Wisdom — dazzling, transparent, impossible to look upon directly, yet pure and liberating. Alongside it, another light appears: a dull, smoky glow, the path of hell born from anger.

Because of old habits, you may shrink from the radiant white light, startled by its brilliance, and instead feel a strange pull toward the smoky haze. Do not be deceived. That haze is the snare of anger; if you follow it, you will fall into the suffering worlds of hell.

Instead, hear these words: Do not fear the dazzling white light. It is the grace of Vajrasattva shining upon you. Rest in it with faith and humility, and pray:

*Alas! Wandering in the cycle of birth and death through violent anger,*

*May I be led by the radiant white path of Mirror-like Wisdom.*

*May the Bhagavān Vajrasattva shine before me,*

*May the Divine Mother Māmakī guard my back.*

*May I cross safely the fearful ambush of the Bardo,*

*And awaken into the All-Perfect Buddhahood of the Eastern Realm.*

Pray thus with your whole heart, and you will merge into the rainbow radiance of Vajrasattva, attaining freedom in the realm of joy.
