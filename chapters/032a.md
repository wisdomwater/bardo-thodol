# Chapter 32: The Dawning of the Lights of the Six Lokas

O nobly-born, now the body of your past life grows dim, and the body of your future life grows clear. You will feel sorrow and think, *“What misery! I must seek a body again.”* So you will wander, restless, searching.

Then the lights of the Six Realms will shine upon you:

* a dull white light of the gods (Deva-world),
* a dull green light of the titans (Asura-world),
* a dull yellow light of human beings,
* a dull blue light of the animals,
* a dull red light of the hungry ghosts (Preta-world),
* a smoke-colored light of the hells.

By the pull of karma, your own form will begin to take the color of the realm toward which you are drawn.

O nobly-born, remember this sacred art: whatever light you see, regard it as the radiance of the Compassionate One. Whatever world it comes from, see it as a display of the Compassionate One. This practice will keep you from rebirth.

If you cannot hold this, then meditate upon your tutelary deity, your heart’s guiding image. See them as vivid yet illusory, like a magician’s conjured form. Let this image dissolve into emptiness. Rest in the union of clarity and voidness. Alternate between the form of the deity and the formless Clear Light.

Finally, allow even your own sense of self to dissolve. As air pervades space, so consciousness pervades all. And as consciousness pervades, so does the Dharma-Kāya. Rest in this uncreated state, and rebirth will be cut off. Here, Perfect Enlightenment is possible.
