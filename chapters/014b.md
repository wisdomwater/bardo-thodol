### What It Means

The Fifth Day reveals how jealousy blinds the soul. The green radiance is the wisdom of enlightened action — the clarity that knows what to do, and how to serve, without hesitation. But jealousy twists action into rivalry: we compare, compete, and struggle for status.

In the Bardo, this distortion appears as attraction to the asura light: the realm of conflict, where beings live in constant combat, never satisfied, always striving. The teaching warns that if you follow that path, you inherit endless struggle.

The remedy is *impartiality*. The text instructs the soul to rest in a state of evenness, not pushed by fear nor pulled by attraction. This balance allows the wisdom of action to shine, transforming impulse into compassionate power.
