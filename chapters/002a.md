# Chapter 2: The Reading of the Words

If, at the moment of death, one is already liberated, there is no need for this book. But if not, then let these words be read with care and with love.

Let them be read clearly, distinctly, as though the one who has departed were sitting right here, listening. Even if the body is gone, sit where they once sat, and imagine their presence. Speak to them as if they are still near, because they are.

Let there be no wailing, no sorrowful outcry — for such sounds can confuse and disturb the spirit. Instead, let the room be still, filled with quiet compassion.

The reading may be done by a teacher, a trusted friend, or someone who held the heart of the departed. Let the words be spoken close to the ear, not as a formality, but as a whisper of guidance.

If offerings can be made, let them be offered. If not, let the offering be the heart’s devotion, infinite in its sincerity. Let prayers of good wishes be spoken, not once, but many times, invoking protection, safety, and courage.

Thus begins the *Great Liberation by Hearing*:

* first, to guide the soul at the moment of death,
* second, to set them face-to-face with Reality in the bardo,
* and third, to guide them safely when new birth approaches.
