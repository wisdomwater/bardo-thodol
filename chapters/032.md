## The Dawning of the Lights of the Six Lokas

O nobly-born, now the body of your past life grows dim, and the body of your future life grows clear. You will feel sorrow and think, *“What misery! I must seek a body again.”* So you will wander, restless, searching.

Then the lights of the Six Realms will shine upon you:

* a dull white light of the gods (Deva-world),
* a dull green light of the titans (Asura-world),
* a dull yellow light of human beings,
* a dull blue light of the animals,
* a dull red light of the hungry ghosts (Preta-world),
* a smoke-colored light of the hells.

By the pull of karma, your own form will begin to take the color of the realm toward which you are drawn.

O nobly-born, remember this sacred art: whatever light you see, regard it as the radiance of the Compassionate One. Whatever world it comes from, see it as a display of the Compassionate One. This practice will keep you from rebirth.

If you cannot hold this, then meditate upon your tutelary deity, your heart’s guiding image. See them as vivid yet illusory, like a magician’s conjured form. Let this image dissolve into emptiness. Rest in the union of clarity and voidness. Alternate between the form of the deity and the formless Clear Light.

Finally, allow even your own sense of self to dissolve. As air pervades space, so consciousness pervades all. And as consciousness pervades, so does the Dharma-Kāya. Rest in this uncreated state, and rebirth will be cut off. Here, Perfect Enlightenment is possible.

### What It Means

This passage describes the transition when the pull of rebirth begins to stir. The dying person sees the lights of the Six Realms — the habitual destinations of consciousness shaped by karma: divine, titanic, human, animal, hungry ghost, or hellish states.

The dullness of these lights contrasts with the brilliance of the earlier wisdom lights. They reflect the pull of old habits and attachments. What we loved, feared, or clung to in life now draws us like gravity.

The teaching offers an “art” — a profound shift of perception: to see every light, even those of lower realms, as emanations of compassion. Instead of being lured or repelled, one recognizes them as part of the divine play, as one’s own mind. This recognition breaks the chain of karma and opens the gate to liberation.

It is also a teaching about practice: form and formlessness. To meditate on a deity and then dissolve that image into clear light is to train in letting go of all appearances. It is practice in dying itself — resting in the luminous void where rebirth is no longer necessary.

*Breathing in, I see every light as compassion.
Breathing out, I rest in the embrace of the Dharma-Kāya.
Breathing in, I release my search for another body.
Breathing out, I awaken in the Clear Light.*

*O Compassionate One,
when the lights of the six realms call me,
let me not be drawn by fear or desire.
Let me see only You —
in gods and humans, in animals and hungry ghosts,
in heaven and in hell.
In every light, let me behold the radiance of the Dharma-Kāya.
In this recognition, may I awaken to freedom.*
