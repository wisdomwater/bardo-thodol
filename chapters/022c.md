### Reflection

Close your eyes and imagine a deep red lotus blazing with fire. From it shines a radiant being of fierce compassion. Breathe into the heart, and whisper:

*This fierce love is my own.*

*This burning fire is compassion.*

*I will not fear. I will recognize.*

*In recognition, I am free.*
