### What It Means

This passage shows immense tenderness. It admits that most of us, in the chaos of death, will be forgetful. Fear, pain, or guilt may overwhelm even those who practiced in life. Yet the teaching insists: liberation is still possible.

The key is *remembrance*, often with the help of another’s voice. The instruction to meditate on compassion is not a fallback — it is the heart of the path. To turn to compassion, even when confused, is to align with the Light itself.

The imagery of the “illusory body” is powerful. After death, the soul is not bound as before; it is light-filled, hovering near what it loved. In this delicate state, a gentle reminder can make all the difference, opening the way before karmic visions take hold.
