## The Alternative Choosing: Supernormal Birth or Womb-Birth

O nobly-born, if karma compels you to enter a womb, hear this teaching. Do not enter blindly into the first doorway that appears. If tormenting furies press you, call upon Hayagriva for strength.

At this time you possess a subtle power of foreknowledge. One by one, the places of possible birth will appear to you. Choose with care.

Two paths are open:

1. The transference of consciousness into a pure Buddha realm.
2. The selection of a womb-door within the cycle of samsara.

Choose wisely.

### What It Means

This passage confronts us with the ultimate choice of rebirth. Even in the midst of confusion and karmic pressure, the teachings remind us: *pause, recognize, and choose consciously*. Not every doorway that opens is meant for us. Some lead into cycles of suffering; others, into realms of clarity.

The teaching highlights our latent foreknowledge in this state — a faint intuition of what lies beyond each doorway. The appearance of options is not random; it is the flowering of our karma. Still, by remembering, by praying, and by invoking compassion, there remains freedom to choose differently.

Supernormal birth into a Pure Land — the Buddha realms of light and wisdom — represents liberation. Entering a womb is re-entry into samsara, where lessons continue in fleshly form. Both paths are possibilities, but one leads beyond suffering.

### Reflection


Allow your breath to deepen, carrying kindness inward. Quietly say:


*Breathing in, I open to choice.*

*Breathing out, I rest in freedom.*


*O Compassionate One,*

*when doors appear before me,*

*grant me discernment.*


*May I not rush in fear,*

*nor cling in desire.*

*May I choose with clarity,*

*guided by love.*


*If rebirth awaits,*

*let it be in a place of awakening.*

*If liberation calls,*

*may I recognize it*

*and rest in the Pure Land.*
