### What It Means

This is the teaching of illusion — one of the deepest keys in Buddhist thought. Everything that appears, whether beautiful or terrifying, parental or monstrous, is mind’s projection. To take these projections as ultimately real is to be trapped in Sangsāra.

But when we recognize them as illusions — fleeting, dreamlike, without lasting substance — the spell is broken. The doorway of rebirth cannot hold us, because there is no real “door” to pass through.

The practice here is one of radical letting go: loosening the grip of belief in appearances, whether they inspire fear or desire. In that loosening, liberation becomes possible.
