### Reflection

Take a slow breath in through your nose and feel your chest expand. Gently say:

*In the mirror of karma,*

*may I see only truth.*

*In the forms of terror,*

*may I see my own mind.*

*In the Lord of Death,*

*may I see the Compassionate One.*

*O Radiant Void,*

*O Bright Clear Mind,*

*hold me now.*

*May fear dissolve into recognition,*

*and recognition into freedom.*
