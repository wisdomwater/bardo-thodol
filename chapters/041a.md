# Chapter 41: The Premonitory Visions of the Place of Rebirth

O nobly-born, now the signs of the place of rebirth will appear before you. Recognize them.

If you see a lake with swans upon it, that is the Eastern Continent of Lüpah. Do not go there. Though there is ease and bliss, the Dharma does not flourish there.

If you see splendid mansions, that is the Southern Continent of Jambu. If you must take birth, enter there.

If you see a lake with horses grazing near its shores, that is the Western Continent of Balang-Chöd. Do not go there, for although abundance reigns, religion does not.

If you see a lake with cattle or beautiful trees, that is the Northern Continent of Daminyan. Though long life is found there, the Dharma is not. Do not go there.

If you see radiant temples of precious metals, you may enter — for that is the realm of the gods.

If you see forests or fiery circles, that is the realm of the asuras. Turn away.

If you see caverns, holes, or mists, that is the realm of beasts. Enter not.

If you see wastelands, plains without trees, or empty glades, that is the realm of hungry ghosts. Do not go.

If you hear cries of lament and see dark roads, black holes, or shadowy houses, that is the realm of Hell. Turn back; go not there, lest you suffer long.

Exert your strength now. Resist these doors.
