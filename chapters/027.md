# Chapter 27: Conclusion - The Power of the Bardo Teachings

Whatever practices a person may have undertaken in life — whether great or small — illusions will arise at the time of death. For this reason, the *Thödol*, the “Great Liberation by Hearing,” is indispensable.

For those who have practiced meditation deeply, the Truth itself dawns instantly when body and mind part. Those who have recognized their true nature even a little while alive will find great strength when the Clear Light shines at death.

Those who have trained in visualizing and embodying the deities of the Mantra Path will find this practice vital when the Peaceful and Wrathful deities appear in the *Chönyid Bardo*. The training itself is precious — to study, to memorize, to hear these words again and again so that even if a hundred distractions or fears arose, the essence would not be forgotten.

This text is called the *Great Liberation by Hearing* because even those who have committed the gravest of sins can be freed simply by hearing its words. Therefore it should be read in public gatherings, whispered in the ears of the dying, placed under the pillow of the sick, and spoken beside the dead.

Fortunate indeed are those who meet these teachings. Rare it is to encounter them, and rarer still to understand them. Yet even a single hearing plants a seed. Even without full comprehension, in the Bardo these words return to the mind with clarity.

So treat this teaching as a treasure. It is the distilled essence of all doctrines. To hear it without disbelief is already to step onto the path of liberation.

Here ends the *Setting-Face-to-Face while Experiencing Reality in the Intermediate State*, known as *The Teaching Which Liberates by Mere Hearing, and by Mere Connection*.

### What It Means

This conclusion reminds us that the practice of recognition is the heart of liberation. Meditation, visualization, devotion — all prepare the mind to meet the ultimate test: can we recognize our own mind as the source of light, deities, and visions at death?

The teaching also insists that compassion is practical: reading the text for others — the sick, the dying, even the dead — plants seeds of awakening. The words themselves hold power, especially in the heightened clarity of the Bardo.

And it comforts us: even if our lives have been tangled with mistakes, even if we have committed terrible wrongs, this teaching offers a path of liberation. Recognition can arise in a single moment.

### Reflection

In this conclusion, remember the words and whisper:

*This teaching is a gift,*

*ancient and compassionate.*

*Even now, hearing it,*

*my mind opens to light.*

*I carry it within me,*

*to guide myself and others*

*through fear, through death,*

*into the Great Liberation.*
