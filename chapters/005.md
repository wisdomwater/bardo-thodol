# Chapter 5: The Radiance of Compassion

Beloved one, the final dissolutions are upon you. Earth sinks into water, water into fire, fire into air, and air into space. The body fades, and the mind opens to the vast expanse.

At this moment, keep your mind steady. Do not be distracted. Listen:
*O noble soul, this is the hour of death. By entering this passage, may you awaken for the good of all beings. Resolve with love and compassion: “May this very death become the doorway to Buddhahood. May I use it to serve every being, as countless as the sky.”*

Even if full awakening is beyond reach, hold this vow: *“I will master the in-between state. I will take whatever form may help others. I will not turn away from compassion.”*

Now, as the Clear Light shines, recognize it. Your own mind, naked and luminous, is not a void of nothingness but a living radiance — unobstructed, blissful, and free. This very consciousness is the Buddha, the All-Good.

Know this truth: your awareness and the radiant Light are not two. They are one union, the body of Perfect Enlightenment itself.

### What It Means

Here the text adds something profound: dying is not only an opportunity for personal liberation, but for *the flowering of compassion*. The instruction is to meet death not with fear or grasping, but with a vow to awaken for the sake of others.

This shifts the whole meaning of death. It is not merely about one’s own fate, but about love without limits. The dying soul is reminded: *You are not a flickering candle being snuffed out, but the very light itself, inseparable from the source of all goodness.*

Even if recognition is partial, even if the Clear Light is not fully realized, this compassionate resolve plants the deepest seed. It is the heart’s offering, strong enough to shape the journey ahead.

### Reflection

Sit quietly and place your hand over your heart. Imagine your last breath leaving, and in its place a vast radiance opening. In that radiance, let compassion arise. Whisper within:

*May this life, and even my death, serve all beings.*

*May I awaken, not for myself alone, but for love without measure.*

*My mind and the Light are one.*

*In this union, there is no fear, only freedom.*
