# Chapter 34: The First Method of Closing the Womb-Door

O nobly-born, if you are drawn toward a womb, remember this teaching.

Whoever your tutelary deity may be, visualize them calmly — like the reflection of the moon upon water: shining, present, yet without true substance. If you have no tutelary deity, then meditate upon the Compassionate Lord, or even upon the one reading these words to you.

Let the form of the deity dissolve gradually from the edges inward, until only the clear, formless Light remains. Rest in that Light without forming thoughts. This profound practice alone can prevent you from entering a womb.

If, despite this, you feel yourself being drawn into a womb, then listen to the teaching of the First Method of Closing the Womb-Door:

When the Sidpa Bardo is dawning upon me,
May I hold one pure resolve in mind.
May I join the chain of good karma,
Close the womb-door, and remember the way of opposition.
At this time, earnestness and pure love are required;
Let me abandon jealousy and meditate upon the Guru as Father-Mother.

Repeat these words aloud if you can, and keep their meaning vividly in your heart.

Know this: in the Sidpa Bardo, you no longer cast a shadow, nor see your reflection in water or in mirrors. This is the sign that you no longer carry the gross body of flesh and blood. You now wander in the subtle body of desire.

At this time, form a single, unwavering resolve. It is like guiding a horse with reins — wherever your resolve points, your destiny follows. Do not let the mind dwell on harmful actions; hold only to the chain of good. Remember the bond with your guru, or with any who gave you teachings in the human life. Hold fast to that connection, for it can carry you upward.

The dividing line between liberation and bondage, between ascent and descent, is before you now. Even one moment of hesitation may cast you into long misery. Therefore, remain steadfast. Persist in the good. This is the moment of closing the womb-door.
