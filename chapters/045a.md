# Chapter 45: Womb-Birth: The Return to the Human World

O nobly-born, if supernormal birth into a Pure Land is not possible, and you must take birth in this world again, listen well.

With your foresight, look across the Continents. Choose the land where Dharma is strong and enter there.

When birth is near, you may see what looks impure yet smells sweet — a vision drawing you toward it. Do not be deceived. Appearances can mislead.

Choose carefully, directing your wish:
“May I take birth as one able to serve beings — as a Universal Emperor, a Brāhmin like a great tree, the child of an adept, or in a family of faith. May I be endowed with merit and live to benefit all.”

As you enter the womb, send forth waves of compassion. Transform the place of birth into a celestial palace. Believe that Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and the Great Compassionate One bless your new life.

But beware: through karma, good wombs may appear bad, and bad wombs good. Do not cling. Do not reject. Enter impartially, with a mind free from attraction or repulsion.

If you cannot do this, take refuge in the Precious Trinity, in the Great Compassionate One. Cast off longing for children, wealth, or kin — they cannot help you now. Enter upon the Light of the devas or the Yellow Light of humans.
