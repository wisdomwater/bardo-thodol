### What It Means

The Seventh Day brings the most dramatic display yet — Knowledge-Holders, Ḍākinīs, and hosts of fierce protectors filling the sky with sound, dance, and radiance. It is overwhelming by design: the soul is shaken free of its old habits and compelled to recognize truth.

The teaching insists again: all of this arises from within. The lights, the sounds, the terrifying cries, the fierce dances — these are not enemies. They are the purified powers of your own heart and mind, dazzling you into remembrance.

The danger lies in preferring the dull blue light of ignorance, the lure of the brute realm. To choose this is to turn away from brilliance out of fear, settling for a life of dull instinct and bondage. The choice is clear: do not cling to the dim familiar. Step into the rainbow radiance.
