# Chapter 20: The Ninth Day — Vajra-Heruka Appears

Beloved one, listen closely and without distraction. If you turned away from the vision of the Great Heruka, then today the blood-drinking deities of the Vajra Order will appear before you.

From the eastern quarter of your mind will emerge Bhagavān Vajra-Heruka, dark blue in color, with three faces, six hands, and four powerful legs. In his right hands he holds a dorje, a skull-bowl, and a battle-axe. In his left hands he bears a bell, another skull-bowl, and a ploughshare.

He is embraced by the Mother, Vajra-Krotiśaurima, who clasps his neck with her right hand while offering him a red shell filled with blood with her left. Together they blaze forth, radiant and fierce, shining directly upon you.

Do not fear them. Do not recoil in terror or awe. Know this: they are the reflection of your own mind. Vajra-Heruka is none other than Vajra-Sattva, Father and Mother, appearing now in wrathful form. If you recognize this truth, and merge with them in oneness, liberation will come at once, and Buddhahood will be attained.

### What It Means

The Wrathful Deities intensify here, arising from the Vajra family — the lineage of clarity, diamond-like wisdom, and indestructibility. They seem terrifying: dark blue, blood-drinking, surrounded by symbols of death and power. Yet the teaching insists: they are not alien beings. They are your own mind’s wisdom, shining in fierce form.

The skull-bowls, axes, and flames symbolize the cutting away of delusion, pride, and fear. These are not punishments, but tools of liberation. The blood-drinking imagery is meant to show how even death itself is consumed by awareness.

The challenge is simple but profound: to look upon what terrifies you and see it as your own essence. If you recognize Vajra-Heruka as your own inner light, the terrifying dissolves into the liberating.

### Reflection

Imagine a fierce, radiant being, blue as midnight, blazing with eyes and arms. Let fear rise, but hold steady. Whisper to yourself:

*This is my mind in its fierce form.*

*This is wisdom unshakable,*

*diamond-clear and indestructible.*

*I will not fear. I will recognize.*

*In recognition, I am free.*
