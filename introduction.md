# Introduction

There is a time between breaths, a quiet pause between the in-breath and the out-breath. In Tibetan tradition, that space is called a *bardo*—an interval, a threshold, a passageway. Life itself is filled with bardos: the moments between waking and sleeping, between despair and hope, between what was and what is yet to be. The *Bardo Thödol*, often called *The Tibetan Book of the Dead*, is a guide for the greatest threshold of all—the passage from life through death into whatever lies beyond.

This text was originally read aloud beside the dying and the dead. Its words are not meant as abstract philosophy, but as direct guidance, like the voice of a trusted companion whispering courage into the ear of one who is traveling on alone. It reminds the soul that even in fearsome visions, there is nothing to fear; even in the face of death, there is only life continuing in another form.

The version you hold here is not a scholarly translation but a devotional rendering, a warm re-telling for modern hearts. The older translations, beautiful though they are, often feel distant with their archaic language. Here, the aim is clarity and compassion. Each section has been gently re-voiced so that it may speak directly to you, the reader, whether you are facing death, grieving someone you love, or simply wanting to live more awake to the passing beauty of each moment.

These teachings are not only for the dying. They are for the living—for you and for me—so that we may learn to meet change with less fear, to let go of what binds us, and to walk with compassion in this fragile, luminous life. Read them slowly. Let them soak into you like prayer. Use them as you sit in silence, as you walk in grief, as you reflect on impermanence, or as you prepare for your own journey one day.

The bardos remind us: nothing is fixed, everything is passage. And within each passage lies the possibility of awakening.
