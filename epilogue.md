# Epilogue

We have walked together through the landscapes of the *Bardo Thödol*—visions radiant and terrifying, prayers of protection, reminders of what endures when everything else falls away. Though the imagery may feel strange or unfamiliar, the heart of these teachings is simple: do not be afraid. Whatever arises—light or darkness, beauty or horror—it is the mind’s own reflection, passing like clouds through the vast sky of awareness.

For centuries, these words have been read to the dying as a lamp in the night. Yet they are not only for the moment of death. They are for all the small deaths and rebirths we live each day: the letting go of what no longer serves, the surrender to change, the courage to meet the unknown. In this sense, every one of us lives in a bardo, always standing on the threshold of something new.

The text closes with a blessing, and perhaps that is the best way to leave it—with a prayer of goodwill. May these words steady you when you tremble, soften you when you cling, and open you when fear would close you off. May they help you see that nothing is wasted, not even suffering, when it is held in the great light of compassion.

We cannot avoid the bardos. But we can learn to walk them with clarity, with trust, and with love. And in that walking, we discover the truth that death does not end the journey—it simply opens the way to another beginning.

**A Final Blessing**

May your steps be steady in every passage.
May fear dissolve into light,
and sorrow open into wisdom.
May you remember, in life and in death,
that you are never alone.
The Compassionate Ones walk with you—
always.
